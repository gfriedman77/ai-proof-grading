1. **Notation and Clarity**: When you write $y = (x+c) - x$, it seems like a typographical error. You should write $y = (x+y) - x$ to maintain consistency with your earlier statements.

2. **Rational Representation**: You correctly represent $x$ and $x+y$ as rational numbers, but you should explicitly state that $x = \frac{a}{b}$ and $x+y = \frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b, c, d$ are integers and $b, d \neq 0$. This makes it clear that you are using the definition of rational numbers.

3. **Simplification Step**: When you simplify $y = \frac{c}{d} - \frac{a}{b}$ to $y = \frac{cb - ad}{db}$, it would be helpful to explicitly state that this is a rational number because both the numerator and the denominator are integers, and the denominator is non-zero.

4. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion is correct, but it could be more clearly stated. You should emphasize that the contradiction arises because you assumed $y$ was irrational, but derived that $y$ is rational, which contradicts the initial assumption.

2. **Inductive Step**: You correctly assumed $ P(k) $ is true and aimed to prove $ P(k+1) $. However, there are some issues in the algebraic manipulation:

   - When you wrote $ 5+10+15+20+\ldots+5k+5(k+1) = \frac{5(k+1)((k+1)+1)}{2} $, you should have started with the assumption $ 5+10+15+20+\ldots+5k = \frac{5k(k+1)}{2} $ and then added $ 5(k+1) $ to both sides.

1. **Understanding Contraposition**: The original statement is ""If $ a $ does not divide $ bc $, then $ a $ does not divide $ b $."" The contrapositive of this statement is ""If $ a $ divides $ b $, then $ a $ divides $ bc $."" This is what you need to prove.

2. **Assumptions**: You correctly start by assuming $ a \mid b $ (i.e., $ a $ divides $ b $) as part of proving the contrapositive. However, you also assume $ a \mid bc $, which is not necessary for the contrapositive. Instead, you should assume $ a \mid b $ and show that this implies $ a \mid bc $.

3. **Proof Structure**: You correctly state that if $ a \mid b $, then there exists an integer $ k $ such that $ b = ak $. You then substitute this into $ bc $ to get $ bc = akc $.

4. **Conclusion**: You correctly conclude that since $ bc = akc $, and $ akc $ is clearly divisible by $ a $ (since it is $ a \times (kc) $), it follows that $ a \mid bc $.

The main issue is the initial assumption of $ a \mid bc $, which is not needed for the contrapositive. You should only assume $ a \mid b $ and then show that this leads to $ a \mid bc $.

2. **Showing $\operatorname{null}(T) = \{\overrightarrow{0}\}$ implies $T$ is one-to-one**: You correctly show that if $T(v_1) = T(v_2)$, then $T(v_1 - v_2) = \overrightarrow{0}_W$, which implies $v_1 - v_2 \in \operatorname{null}(T)$. Since $\operatorname{null}(T) = \{\overrightarrow{0}\}$, it follows that $v_1 - v_2 = \overrightarrow{0}_V$, hence $v_1 = v_2$. This part is correct.

3. **Showing $T$ is one-to-one implies $\operatorname{null}(T) = \{\overrightarrow{0}\}$**: You correctly argue that if $v \in \operatorname{null}(T)$, then $T(v) = \overrightarrow{0}_W$. Since $T$ is one-to-one, this implies $v = \overrightarrow{0}_V$. This part is also correct.

4. **Notation**: Be consistent with your notation. You use both $\operatorname{null}(T)$ and $\operatorname{Null}(T)$. It's best to stick to one notation throughout the proof.

5. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion is correct, but it could be more explicit. You should clearly state that you have shown both directions of the ""if and only if"" statement.

1. **Incorrect Row Reduction**: The row reduction you performed on the augmented matrix is incorrect. The transformation from the original matrix to the reduced echelon form (REF) is not valid. Specifically, the entries in the third column of your REF matrix, $\frac{j-b}{a-b}$ and $\frac{k-c}{d-c}$, do not follow from any valid row operations on the original matrix. The correct REF should involve operations that use the condition $ad - bc \neq 0$ to eliminate variables systematically.

2. **Misinterpretation of the Uniqueness Theorem**: The Uniqueness Theorem you mentioned is not correctly applied. The theorem should be based on the rank of the coefficient matrix and the augmented matrix. For a system of two equations with two variables, the system has a unique solution if the coefficient matrix is invertible, which is equivalent to having a non-zero determinant ($ad - bc \neq 0$).

3. **Lack of Justification for Pivot Positions**: You claim that there are two pivot entries in the REF, but this is not justified by the row operations you performed. The presence of pivot positions should be derived from valid row operations that lead to a triangular form, not assumed.

4. **Incorrect Use of Constants**: The expressions $\frac{j-b}{a-b}$ and $\frac{k-c}{d-c}$ are not correctly derived from the system of equations. The constants $j$ and $k$ should be manipulated using valid row operations that respect the original equations.

To correct these issues, you should perform valid row operations to transform the original augmented matrix into a form that clearly shows the pivot positions, ensuring that the determinant condition $ad - bc \neq 0$ is used to justify the existence of a unique solution.",No they say different things,RIGHT - not sure what human is saying here,No they say different things,RIGHT - plus one confusing comment but mostly right,Correct/mostly correct,,0,0,1,1

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Misinterpretation of Linear Dependence**: You start by stating that if $S$ is linearly dependent, then any vector in $\operatorname{Span}(S)$ should also be linearly dependent. This is a misuse of terminology. Linear dependence is a property of a set of vectors, not of a single vector. A single vector cannot be linearly dependent or independent; these terms apply to sets of vectors.

2. **Confusion about Linear Combinations**: You claim that because $\vec{w} \in \operatorname{Span}(S)$, it ""has infinite types since coefficient is different."" This statement is unclear and incorrect. While it is true that a vector in the span of a linearly dependent set can often be expressed as a linear combination of the set in multiple ways, this is not because the vector itself is ""linearly dependent"" or has ""infinite types.""

3. **Lack of Logical Justification**: The proof lacks a clear logical structure and justification for why a vector in the span of a linearly dependent set can be expressed in more than one way.

The student incorrectly added an existential quantifier to the part 'r is a rational number'.","Your proof attempts to use contradiction to show that if $ r^2 = 2 $, then $ r $ is irrational. However, there are several issues with the proof:

1. **Negation Misunderstanding**: The negation of the statement ""for all real numbers $ r $, if $ r^2 = 2 $, then $ r $ is an irrational number"" is ""there exists a real number $ r $ such that $ r^2 = 2 $ and $ r $ is a rational number."" Your proof should start by assuming this negation.

2. **Assumption of $ r = \pm \sqrt{2} $**: You state that $ r = \pm \sqrt{2} $ and then claim that these are irrational. However, you need to show why assuming $ r $ is rational leads to a contradiction, not just state that $ \sqrt{2} $ is irrational.

2. **Induction Hypothesis**: You correctly state the induction hypothesis, assuming that the statement holds for some positive integer $ k $.

3. **Inductive Step**: This is where the proof has significant issues. You need to show that if the statement holds for $ n = k $, then it must also hold for $ n = k+1 $. However, your explanation is unclear and contains algebraic errors. Specifically:
   - You need to express $ (1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + (k+1))^2 $ in terms of the sum up to $ k $ and the additional term $ k+1 $.
   - The expression $ (1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + (k+1))^2 $ should be expanded as $ ((1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + k) + (k+1))^2 $.
   - You should use the formula for the sum of the first $ n $ integers: $ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $, and then square it.
   - The step where you equate $ (((1+k)k)/2)^2 $ to $ 1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + k^3 $ is correct by the induction hypothesis, but the transition to $ (1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + (k+1))^2 $ is not clearly justified or correctly calculated.

Let's go through the proof and identify the issue:

1. **Base Case:** You correctly proved that the base case $P(1)$ is true. This part is fine.

2. **Inductive Step:**
   - You correctly assumed $P(k)$ is true: $5 + 10 + 15 + \ldots + 5k = \frac{5k(k+1)}{2}$.
   - You correctly set up $P(k+1)$: $5 + 10 + 15 + \ldots + 5k + 5(k+1)$.
   - You correctly substituted the assumption: $\frac{5k(k+1)}{2} + 5(k+1)$.
   - You correctly simplified this to: $\frac{5k^2 + 5k}{2} + \frac{10k + 10}{2}$.
   - You correctly combined terms: $\frac{5k^2 + 15k + 10}{2}$.

   - The correct expression should be: $\frac{5(k+1)(k+2)}{2}$, which you already had in the previous step. There is no need to change it to $\frac{5(k+1)(k+1)+1}{2}$, as this is incorrect and does not follow from the previous step.

However, there are several areas where the proof could be improved for clarity and rigor. Here are some specific points of feedback:

1. **Notation and Clarity**: 
   - Ensure that your notation is consistent and correct. For example, you have written $ T(\vec{x}=A \vec{x} $ without closing the parentheses. It should be $ T(\vec{x}) = A \vec{x} $.
   - Use clear and precise language. For instance, when you say ""the $ T $ can be reduced to identity matrix,"" it would be clearer to say ""the matrix representation of $ T $ can be row-reduced to the identity matrix.""

2. **Logical Flow**:
   - When proving that $ T $ is one-to-one if $ A $ is invertible, you correctly use the fact that the null space of $ A $ is trivial. However, your explanation could be more direct by stating that since $ A $ is invertible, the only solution to $ A\vec{x} = \vec{0} $ is $ \vec{x} = \vec{0} $, which implies $ T $ is one-to-one.
   - In the converse, when proving that if $ T $ is one-to-one, then $ A $ is invertible, your argument about reducing to the identity matrix is not fully justified. Instead, you should argue that if $ T $ is one-to-one, then the null space of $ A $ is trivial, which implies that $ A $ has full rank and is therefore invertible.

3. **Onto Part**:
   - When proving that $ T $ is onto if $ A $ is invertible, you correctly state that for every $ \vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n $, there exists a solution $ \vec{x} $ such that $ A\vec{x} = \vec{b} $. This is because $ A $ being invertible implies it has full rank.
   - In the converse, when proving that if $ T $ is onto, then $ A $ is invertible, you correctly use the rank-nullity theorem. However, your explanation could be clearer. You should explicitly state that if $ T $ is onto, then the image of $ T $ is all of $ \mathbb{R}^n $, which implies that the rank of $ A $ is $ n $, and thus $ A $ is invertible.

4. **Structure and Completeness**:
   - Make sure each part of your proof is complete and logically follows from the assumptions. For example, when discussing the rank and nullity, explicitly mention the rank-nullity theorem and how it applies to your argument.

When you perform row operations, it's important to clearly state which row is being replaced and how.

2. **Order of Operations**: The sequence of row operations is not clearly justified or explained. It's important to show how each step leads to a simpler form of the system that reveals the solution.

3. **Final Solution**: The final solution is presented without sufficient explanation. You should clarify how the expressions for $x_1$ and $x_2$ are derived from the row-reduced form of the matrix.

4. **Verification of Solution**: It would be beneficial to verify that the solution satisfies both original equations, reinforcing that it is indeed a solution to the system.

5. **Uniqueness Argument**: The proof should explicitly state why the condition $ad - bc \neq 0$ ensures uniqueness. This is related to the determinant of the coefficient matrix being non-zero, which implies that the matrix is invertible and the system has a unique solution.

2. **Linear Combination of Solutions**: You introduce $\vec{Y} = n\vec{u} + (n-1)\vec{v}$ and claim it is a solution. However, for a non-homogeneous system, a linear combination of solutions is not generally a solution unless specific conditions are met (e.g., the system is homogeneous).

3. **Scalar Multiplication**: You mention scalar multiplication but do not correctly apply it to demonstrate the existence of infinitely many solutions. In a non-homogeneous system, scalar multiples of solutions are not solutions unless the system is homogeneous.

4. **Conclusion**: The conclusion that the system has infinitely many solutions based on the existence of two distinct solutions is correct, but the reasoning provided is flawed. The correct reasoning involves understanding that if two distinct solutions exist, the difference between them is a non-zero solution to the associated homogeneous system, which implies a line (or higher-dimensional affine space) of solutions.

   - Your statement ""[a] we need to show $\overrightarrow{0}_{\mathbb{R}^n} \in \vec{x}$"" is unclear. You should show that the zero vector $\overrightarrow{0} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies $ A\overrightarrow{0} = \overrightarrow{0} $, which is straightforward since $ A\overrightarrow{0} $ is always $\overrightarrow{0}$.

This was never stated in the theorem, and in fact the theorem has to be true for *any* linearly independent set S, so your choice of S is way too restrictive. Start your proof with something more like 'Suppose that S is some linearly independent set, and suppose that there exists a vector w in span(S) that can be written as two different linear combinations from S.' Then you can go on to show that the coefficients must be different in the two linear combinations.","Your proof is mostly correct, but there are a few points that could be clarified or improved for precision and clarity:

1. **Notation and Clarity**: You start by defining $ S = w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n $, but it would be clearer to write $ S = \{\vec{w}_1, \vec{w}_2, \ldots, \vec{w}_n\} $ to emphasize that $ S $ is a set of vectors.

2. **Expression of the Contrapositive**: The contrapositive statement is correctly identified, but it could be more explicitly stated as: ""If there exists a vector $\vec{w} \in \operatorname{span}(S)$ that can be written as a linear combination of vectors in $ S $ in at least two distinct ways, then $ S $ is linearly dependent.""

3. **Explanation of Linear Dependence**: You correctly identify that if a vector can be expressed in two different ways, the difference of these expressions gives a nontrivial linear combination of the vectors in $ S $ that equals the zero vector. This is the key point that shows linear dependence. However, it would be beneficial to explicitly state that this nontrivial combination implies that the vectors in $ S $ are linearly dependent because there exists a nontrivial solution to the equation $ a_1 \vec{w}_1 + a_2 \vec{w}_2 + \ldots + a_n \vec{w}_n = \vec{0} $.

4. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion that the contrapositive being true implies the original statement is true is correct. However, it might be helpful to explicitly state that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, which is why proving the contrapositive suffices.

Also, the student should be more clear on their assumption that a,b,c,d are not zero.","Your proof has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Row Reduction Result**: The reduced row-echelon form (RREF) you provided is incorrect. The transformation of the augmented matrix to RREF should not result in the expressions $(j-b)/(a-b)$ and $(k-c)/(d-c)$. The correct RREF should have the form:

The number of pivot entries should match the number of variables, which is true here, but the reasoning should be based on the determinant condition.

4. **Lack of Clarity in Explanation**: The explanation of why the system has a unique solution is not clearly tied to the properties of the determinant and the invertibility of the matrix.

It does not mean that there is some specific element $x$ that is in both $A$ and $B$. Your proof incorrectly assumes the existence of a specific element $x$ in $A$ and $B$.

2. **Logical Structure**: The proof should demonstrate that for any arbitrary element $x$, if $x \in A$, then $x \in C$. This involves using the transitive property of the subset relation: if $x \in A$, then by $A \subseteq B$, $x \in B$; and if $x \in B$, then by $B \subseteq C$, $x \in C$. Therefore, $x \in A$ implies $x \in C$, which is the definition of $A \subseteq C$.

3. **Conclusion**: The conclusion should be based on the general case for any element $x$, not just a specific instance. You need to show that the implication holds for all elements in $A$.

2. **Linear Independence Definition**: In your proof, you incorrectly apply the definition of linear independence.

A system with more unknowns than equations can indeed have solutions, but it may not have a unique solution or allow you to solve for each variable individually.

In your example, you have two equations with six unknowns: $x, y, z, a, b, c$. The system is underdetermined, meaning there are infinitely many solutions, not no solutions. For instance, you can choose arbitrary values for four of the variables and solve for the remaining two. The fact that you cannot solve for a single variable in terms of the others does not imply that there are no solutions; it simply means that the solutions are not unique.

Your proof correctly identifies this but doesn't clearly connect it to the ability to express any vector in the span in more than one way.

2. **Use of Matrix Notation**: You introduce a matrix $ A $ with columns as vectors from $ S $, which is fine, but you should clarify that $ \vec{x} $ is a vector of coefficients that gives a nontrivial linear combination resulting in the zero vector.

1. **Definition of Linear Dependence**: A set $ S $ is linearly dependent if there exists a nontrivial linear combination of its vectors that equals the zero vector. This means there are scalars, not all zero, such that a linear combination of the vectors in $ S $ equals zero. It does not necessarily mean that $ S $ contains scalar multiples or a zero vector, although these are specific cases of linear dependence.

2. **Zero Vector**: You mention letting $\vec{w} = \overrightarrow{0_S}$, but it's unclear what $\overrightarrow{0_S}$ refers to. If you mean the zero vector, then indeed, the zero vector can be expressed as a linear combination of any set of vectors in infinitely many ways. However, this doesn't directly address the general case for any $\vec{w} \in \operatorname{span}(S)$.

3. **Scalar Multiples**: You mention scalar multiples and adding them to $\vec{w}$ to make it linearly dependent, but this is not clear. The focus should be on expressing $\vec{w}$ as a linear combination of vectors in $ S $ in more than one way, not on making $\vec{w}$ linearly dependent.

4. **General Case**: The proof should address the general case for any $\vec{w} \in \operatorname{span}(S)$, not just specific cases like the zero vector or scalar multiples. The key idea is that if $ S $ is linearly dependent, there exists a nontrivial linear combination of vectors in $ S $ that equals zero.

1. **Terminology and Definitions**: You correctly identify that the rank of a matrix $ A $ is the dimension of its image, and the nullity is the dimension of its null space. However, you should explicitly state that the rank-nullity theorem is what you're proving, which states that for a linear transformation $ T: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m $ represented by a matrix $ A $, the sum of the rank and nullity equals the number of columns $ n $.

2. **Use of Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)**: You mention using the RREF of $ A $ to determine the rank and nullity. While this is a common method, you should clarify that the rank is the number of pivot columns in the RREF, and the nullity is the number of free variables, which corresponds to the number of non-pivot columns.

3. **Explanation of Variables**: You introduce variables $ a $ and $ b $ to represent the number of pivot columns and free columns, respectively. It would be clearer to explicitly state that $ a = \operatorname{rank}(A) $ and $ b = \operatorname{nullity}(A) $, and then show that $ a + b = n $.

4. **Logical Flow**: The proof could benefit from a more structured logical flow. Start by defining the rank and nullity in terms of the RREF, then show how these relate to the dimensions of the image and null space, and finally conclude with the rank-nullity theorem.

This can be done by noting that the zero vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in $ S $ with all coefficients being zero.

3. **Closure Under Addition and Scalar Multiplication**: You assert that $ \operatorname{span}(S) $ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, but you need to demonstrate this.

1. **Linear Combination of Solutions**: The key idea in showing that a system has infinitely many solutions is to demonstrate that any linear combination of two solutions is also a solution. However, your proof incorrectly suggests that summing the equations $A \vec{u} = \vec{b}$ and $A \vec{v} = \vec{b}$ gives $A(\vec{u} + \vec{v}) = 2\vec{b}$. This is incorrect because the sum of two solutions should still satisfy the original equation, not a scaled version of it. Instead, you should consider the difference $\vec{u} - \vec{v}$, which leads to $A(\vec{u} - \vec{v}) = \vec{0}$, indicating that $\vec{u} - \vec{v}$ is a solution to the homogeneous system $A \vec{x} = \vec{0}$.

2. **Parametrization of Solutions**: The correct approach is to express the general solution as $\vec{x} = \vec{u} + t(\vec{v} - \vec{u})$ for any real number $t$. This shows that there are infinitely many solutions because $t$ can take any real value, not just positive integers.

3. **Choice of $n$**: Your proof incorrectly restricts $n$ to positive integers, which is unnecessary and limits the generality of the argument. The parameter $t$ should be any real number to cover all possible solutions.

4. **Conclusion**: The conclusion that there are infinitely many solutions should be based on the fact that the set of solutions forms a line (or higher-dimensional affine space) in the solution space, parameterized by $t$.

Let's go through them:

1. **Base Case**: You mentioned the base case as $(1+2+3)^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3$, which is incorrect. The base case for this theorem should be $n=1$, not $n=3$. For $n=1$, the statement is $(1)^2 = 1^3$, which is true since both sides equal 1.

2. **Inductive Step**: You need to assume the statement is true for some positive integer $k$, i.e., $(1 + 2 + \ldots + k)^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + k^3$. Then, you need to prove it for $k+1$, i.e., $(1 + 2 + \ldots + (k+1))^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + (k+1)^3$.

3. **Misunderstanding of Induction**: You seem to be confused about how to apply induction. The goal is to show that if the statement holds for $k$, it must also hold for $k+1$. This involves algebraic manipulation and using the assumption that the statement is true for $k$.

4. **Incorrect Algebra**: You attempted to show $k(k+6) = k^3$, which is incorrect and not relevant to the proof. The correct approach involves using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ integers, $1 + 2 + \ldots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, and showing that the square of this sum equals the sum of cubes.

1. You correctly set up the augmented matrix from the vector equation.
2. You performed row operations to reach a form where the third row is $[0, 0, b-a-c \mid -2]$.

The key point of the proof is to determine when the system has no solutions. For a system of linear equations to have no solutions, there must be a row in the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix that corresponds to an inconsistent equation, such as $0 = k$ where $k$ is a non-zero constant.

In your row-echelon form, the third row is $[0, 0, b-a-c \mid -2]$. For this row to represent an inconsistent equation, the left side must be zero while the right side is non-zero. This happens when $b-a-c = 0$, not when $b-a-c \neq 0$.

Therefore, the correct condition for the system to have no solutions is $b = a + c$, which is the opposite of what you concluded.

A complete proof should address both inclusions.

2. **Assumption**: You start by assuming $ x \in A $, but for the left-to-right inclusion, you should start with $ x \in A \cap (B \cup C) $. This means $ x $ is in both $ A $ and $ B \cup C $.

3. **Case Analysis**: You correctly identify two cases based on whether $ x \in B $ or $ x \in C $, but you should explicitly state that these cases arise from $ x \in B \cup C $.

4. **Conclusion**: You need to clearly conclude that in both cases, $ x $ is in $ (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) $, thus showing $ x \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) $.

2. **Incorrect Use of Linear Combinations**: The proof seems to suggest that any linear combination of two solutions is also a solution, which is true for homogeneous systems (where the right-hand side is zero) but not necessarily for non-homogeneous systems. The proof does not address the conditions under which this property holds.

3. **Lack of Clarity in Derivation**: The transition from the expressions for $c_1 A_1, c_2 A_2, \ldots, c_n A_n$ to the final equation involving $bK + k_2$ is not clearly justified. The steps involve assumptions and manipulations that are not adequately explained.

4. **Conclusion Misstep**: The conclusion that there are infinitely many solutions because $b$ can take infinitely many values is not valid without showing that each choice of $b$ results in a valid solution to the original system of equations. The proof does not establish that the new set of values $A$ satisfies the original system for all $b$.

To prove the theorem correctly, you would need to show that if two distinct solutions exist, then the system must be underdetermined (i.e., have more variables than independent equations), which allows for a parameterization of solutions leading to infinitely many solutions.

However, you need to clearly state this linear combination, such as $\vec{u} = a_1\vec{s}_1 + a_2\vec{s}_2 + \cdots + a_n\vec{s}_n$ for some vectors $\vec{s}_1, \vec{s}_2, \ldots, \vec{s}_n$ in $S$ and scalars $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

2. **Zero Vector Misunderstanding**: Your statement ""the zero vector exists in this linear combination"" is misleading. The zero vector is not inherently part of the linear combination; rather, a linear combination of vectors can equal the zero vector if the coefficients are chosen appropriately. The presence of the zero vector in a set is not what makes it linearly dependent.

3. **Linear Dependence**: A set of vectors is linearly dependent if there exists a nontrivial linear combination of these vectors that equals the zero vector.

1. **Definition of $ T $:** You defined $ T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m $ with $ T(\vec{x}) = A\vec{x} $, but $ A $ is an $ n \times n $ matrix, so $ T $ should map from $ \mathbb{R}^n $ to $ \mathbb{R}^n $, not $ \mathbb{R}^m $.

   - The step where you conclude $ x_1 - x_2 = 0 $ because the null space of $ A $ is $\{0\}$ is correct.

3. **Invertibility from One-to-One:**
   - You claim that because $ T $ is one-to-one, $ A $ is invertible by the Invertible Matrix Theorem. This is correct, but you should explicitly state that $ T $ being one-to-one implies that the null space of $ A $ is $\{0\}$, which is a condition for invertibility.

4. **Onto and Invertibility:**
   - Your argument for $ T $ being onto when $ A $ is invertible is not clear. You need to show that for every $ \vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n $, there exists an $ \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n $ such that $ A\vec{x} = \vec{y} $. This follows from the fact that an invertible matrix can be row-reduced to the identity matrix, which implies full rank and thus onto.

5. **Invertibility from Onto:**
   - Similar to the one-to-one case, you correctly state that $ T $ being onto implies $ A $ is invertible by the Invertible Matrix Theorem. However, you should explicitly mention that $ T $ being onto implies that the columns of $ A $ span $\mathbb{R}^n$, which is another condition for invertibility.

   - You correctly found a candidate for $ x $ by setting $ x = \frac{1}{cr - a} $ and showed that it satisfies the equation. This part of the proof is correct, assuming $ cr - a \neq 0 $. However, you should explicitly state that $ cr - a \neq 0 $ to ensure that $ x $ is well-defined.

2. **Uniqueness of the Solution:**
   - Your approach to proving uniqueness is correct in principle. You assume two solutions $ x_1 $ and $ x_2 $ and show that they must be equal. However, there is a small error in your simplification:
     - When you dismiss $ r $ and simplify, you correctly reach the equation $ (a x_1 + 1) x_2 = (a x_2 + 1) x_1 $.
     - The next step should be to simplify this equation to show $ x_1 = x_2 $. You correctly rearrange terms to get $ x_2 = x_1 $, but you should ensure that each step is clearly justified.

3. **Clarification on Conditions:**
   - You should explicitly mention that $ cr - a \neq 0 $ is necessary for the existence of the solution $ x = \frac{1}{cr - a} $. This condition is implicitly used but not stated in your proof.

1. **Direction Misunderstanding**: The proof starts with the implication $(\Rightarrow)$, but it seems to be addressing the wrong direction. You need to show that if $A$ is invertible, then $T$ is one-to-one and onto, not the other way around.

2. **Logical Steps**: The steps you provided for showing $A \vec{x} = \vec{b}$ do not logically lead to the conclusion that $T$ is one-to-one.

3. **Substitution Error**: The substitution $T \vec{b} = \vec{b}$ and $T = 1$ is incorrect and lacks a clear logical basis. The transformation $T$ is a function, not a scalar, so equating it to 1 is not meaningful.

1. **Base Case**: You correctly verify the base case for $ n = 1 $. However, it would be clearer if you explicitly stated that you are checking the base case for $ n = 1 $ and then showed that $ 1^3 + 2 \times 1 = 3 $, which is divisible by 3.

2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: You correctly assume the inductive hypothesis, but it would be clearer if you explicitly stated it as: ""Assume that for some $ k \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} $, $ 3 \mid (k^3 + 2k) $, i.e., there exists an integer $ a $ such that $ k^3 + 2k = 3a $.""

3. **Inductive Step**: You correctly show that $ (k+1)^3 + 2(k+1) $ can be expressed in the form $ 3c $ for some integer $ c $. However, your explanation could be clearer. You should explicitly show the expansion of $ (k+1)^3 + 2(k+1) $ and how it relates to the inductive hypothesis:
   $$
   (k+1)^3 + 2(k+1) = k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1 + 2k + 2 = (k^3 + 2k) + 3k^2 + 3k + 3

   Since $ k^3 + 2k = 3a $ by the inductive hypothesis, you have:
   $$
   (k+1)^3 + 2(k+1) = 3a + 3(k^2 + k + 1) = 3(a + k^2 + k + 1)

Moreover, the statement ""This remains the case even if $\vec{v}_3$ is the sum of infinitely many vectors"" is unclear and not relevant to the finite case typically considered in introductory linear algebra.

It seems like you intended to define $ T $ as $ T = \{ m \in \mathbb{Z} : \exists j \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ such that } m = 5j - 3 \} $.

2. **Logical Flow and Clarity:** The proof lacks clarity in its logical flow. You need to clearly show that every element of $ S $ is in $ T $ and vice versa. This involves demonstrating that for any integer $ n $ in $ S $, there exists an integer $ j $ such that $ n = 5j - 3 $, and for any integer $ m $ in $ T $, there exists an integer $ k $ such that $ m = 5k + 2 $.

3. **Arithmetic Mistake:** You mentioned adding 5 to the set $ T $ and claimed it remains the same. However, adding 5 to each element of $ T $ does not necessarily result in elements of the form $ 5j + 2 $. You need to show that the expressions $ 5k + 2 $ and $ 5j - 3 $ can represent the same set of integers.

4. **Conclusion:** The conclusion $ 5k + 2 = 5j + 2 $ is not justified in your proof. You need to show that for any integer $ n $ of the form $ 5k + 2 $, there exists an integer $ j $ such that $ n = 5j - 3 $, and vice versa.

To correct these issues, you should carefully redefine set $ T $, ensure the logical steps are clear, and verify the equivalence of the two forms $ 5k + 2 $ and $ 5j - 3 $ through appropriate algebraic manipulation.",Yes they say the same thing,"Sort of.

Also, using the symbol = to mean ""will be"" is not standard and should be avoided.","Your proof contains several errors and misunderstandings regarding matrix operations and transposition. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Transpose Definition**: The transpose of a product of matrices is not the product of their transposes in the same order. Instead, $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$. Your theorem statement is incorrect because it claims $(AB^T) = B^T A^T$, which is not generally true.

2. **Matrix Multiplication and Transposition**: When you transpose a product of matrices, the order of multiplication reverses. This is a fundamental property of matrix transposition that your proof does not correctly apply.

3. **Dot Product Misunderstanding**: You mention the dot product of row $i$ of $A$ and column $j$ of $B$, but for $(AB)^T$, you should consider the dot product of column $i$ of $A$ and row $j$ of $B$, which is not the same as what you described.

4. **Entry Calculation**: The entry calculation in your proof is not consistent with the properties of matrix multiplication and transposition. The row $i$, column $j$ entry of $(AB)^T$ should be the row $j$, column $i$ entry of $AB$, which is calculated as the dot product of row $j$ of $B$ and column $i$ of $A$.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion that $(AB^T) = B^T A^T$ is incorrect. The correct relationship is $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$.

However, there are several issues with your proof:

1. **Clarity and Definitions**: You start by letting $ x $ be an element of $ \overline{A \cap B} $, but your explanation of what this means is not clear. The complement $ \overline{A \cap B} $ is the set of all elements in $ U $ that are not in $ A \cap B $. You should explicitly state that $ x \notin A \cap B $.

2. **Logical Flow**: You need to show two inclusions to prove set equality: 
   - First, show that if $ x \in \overline{A \cap B} $, then $ x \in \bar{A} \cup \bar{B} $.
   - Second, show that if $ x \in \bar{A} \cup \bar{B} $, then $ x \in \overline{A \cap B} $.

3. **Incorrect Interpretation**: You mention that $ x $ will be a part of $ U $ where $ A $ and $ B $ do not intersect, which is not precise. Instead, $ x $ should be in $ U $ but not in both $ A $ and $ B $ simultaneously.

4. **Missing Steps**: You need to explicitly show that if $ x \notin A \cap B $, then $ x \notin A $ or $ x \notin B $, which implies $ x \in \bar{A} \cup \bar{B} $. Similarly, if $ x \in \bar{A} \cup \bar{B} $, then $ x \notin A \cap B $.

5. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion that ""the only subset of $ U $ which does not contain $ x $ is the part which contains both $ A $ and $ B $"" is not clearly connected to the logic needed to prove the theorem.

The span of $ S $ should be defined as $\operatorname{span}(S) = \{c_1 \vec{v}_1 + c_2 \vec{v}_2 + \ldots + c_k \vec{v}_k : c_i \in \mathbb{R}\}$.

Typically, Theorem 3.6 would state the conditions for a subset to be a subspace: containing the zero vector, being closed under addition, and being closed under scalar multiplication.

4. **Scalar Multiplication Closure**: You correctly show closure under scalar multiplication, but you should clarify that $ x $ is an arbitrary scalar from the field over which the vector space is defined. You used $\mathbb{R}$, which is fine if $ V $ is a real vector space, but it should be consistent with the field of the vector space.

2. **Existence of Zero Vector**: You mention the existence of the zero vector $\overrightarrow{0}$, but your explanation is a bit confusing. The existence of the zero vector is typically an axiom or a given property in vector spaces, so you don't need to prove it.

3. **Uniqueness Argument**: The core of your proof should focus on showing that if there are two vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{w}$ such that $\vec{v} + \vec{u} = \overrightarrow{0}$ and $\vec{v} + \vec{w} = \overrightarrow{0}$, then $\vec{u} = \vec{w}$.

In a proof by contradiction, you assume the opposite of the thing you're trying to prove, and try to derive a contradiction. The goal isn't to show that 'r is not irrational' -- rather, you must assume that r is rational, and then derive a contradiction.","Your proof attempts to use a proof by contradiction to show that if $ r^2 = 2 $, then $ r $ is irrational. However, there are several issues with your proof:

1. **Misunderstanding of the Goal**: You start by saying ""In order to prove $ r $ isn't irrational we must show that $ r \in \mathbb{R} $."" This is incorrect. The goal is to show that $ r $ is irrational, not to prove that it is real. The statement $ r \in \mathbb{R} $ is given, as $ r $ is a real number by assumption.

2. **Incorrect Assumption**: You assume $ r = \frac{m}{n} $ where $ m, n \in \mathbb{Z} $ and $ n \neq 0 $, which is correct for assuming $ r $ is rational. However, you need to assume that $ m $ and $ n $ are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1) to properly use the properties of even and odd integers in your proof.

3. **Logical Errors**: After reaching $ 2n^2 = m^2 $, you correctly deduce that $ m^2 $ is even, implying $ m $ is even. You then set $ m = 2c $ and substitute back to get $ n^2 = 2c^2 $. However, you incorrectly conclude $ n = (\sqrt{2})c $. This step is flawed because it assumes $ n $ is irrational, which contradicts the assumption that $ n $ is an integer.

4. **Conclusion**: The conclusion that ""the output will always be an irrational number"" is not justified by the steps you provided. The contradiction should arise from showing that both $ m $ and $ n $ must be even, contradicting the assumption that they are coprime.

To fix the proof, you should show that both $ m $ and $ n $ being even leads to a contradiction with the assumption that $ m/n $ is in its simplest form.

The problem asks you to start with any linearly dependent S, then show the conclusion. You need to start with the definition of a linearly dependent set, then build the idea of multiple ways of expressing w. So you should probably begin by using the fact that some non-trivial linear combination of the vectors equals the zero vector, without needing to construct two separate such combinations.","Your proof has a good structure, but there are some issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Misinterpretation of Linear Dependence**: The definition of linear dependence you used is not entirely correct. A set $ S = \{\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \ldots, \vec{v}_k\} $ is linearly dependent if there exist scalars, not all zero, such that $ a_1 \vec{v}_1 + a_2 \vec{v}_2 + \ldots + a_k \vec{v}_k = \vec{0} $. Your proof starts with two different linear combinations equating to zero, which is not necessary for linear dependence.

2. **Substitution and Simplification**: You correctly identified that if $ S $ is linearly dependent, one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. However, your substitution and simplification steps are not clearly justified. You assume $ b_1 \neq 0 $ without loss of generality, but this needs more explanation. In general, you should consider the possibility of any $ b_i \neq 0 $.

3. **Arbitrary Choice of Coefficients**: When you conclude that there are an arbitrary number of ways to express $ \vec{w} $, you need to be more precise. The existence of multiple representations comes from the fact that the coefficients in the linear combination are not uniquely determined due to the linear dependence, but this needs to be shown more rigorously.

4. **Conclusion**: The conclusion that there are multiple ways to express any vector in the span of $ S $ is correct, but the reasoning needs to be more clearly tied to the properties of linear dependence. Specifically, you should emphasize that the non-uniqueness arises because the dependence relation allows for different combinations of coefficients to yield the same vector.

1. **Generalization Assumption**: You start by assuming $V = \mathbb{R}^n$ and $W = \mathbb{R}^m$. While this is a common approach in introductory courses, it's important to note that the theorem is stated for any vector spaces $V$ and $W$, not just $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$. Your proof should ideally address the general case or explicitly state that you're considering finite-dimensional vector spaces for simplicity.

2. **Use of Theorem 3.20**: You mention Theorem 3.20 regarding linear independence and unique representation in the span. While this is correct, it would be helpful to clarify that this theorem is about the injectivity of the linear map $T$ when its matrix representation $A$ has linearly independent columns. This directly relates to the null space being trivial.

3. **Second Direction Clarity**: In the second part of your proof, you correctly use the definition of a one-to-one (injective) function. However, when you let $T(\vec{v}) = T(\vec{u}) = \overrightarrow{0}_W$, you should explicitly state that this implies $\vec{v} = \vec{u} = \overrightarrow{0}_V$ due to injectivity, which directly shows that the only vector in the null space is the zero vector.

4. **Theorem References**: You reference Theorem 3.26 about linear transformations sending zero vectors to zero vectors. While this is a standard property, ensure that your reference is clear and that the theorem is relevant to your argument.

   - The identity matrix is usually denoted as $I_n$ or simply $I$, not $I d_n$.

2. **Logical Flow**:

Finally, writing that the augmented column 'equals to zero' is not proper; it should be that the augmented column contains all zeros.","Your proof is mostly on the right track, but there are a few issues and areas for improvement:

1. **Zero Vector**: Your explanation for the zero vector is a bit unclear. You mention ""$\overrightarrow{0} * V \in \operatorname{span}(s)$"" which seems to be a typo or misunderstanding. You should simply state that the zero vector $\vec{0}$ is in $\operatorname{span}(S)$ because you can take all coefficients in the linear combination to be zero, i.e., $0 \cdot \vec{v}_1 + 0 \cdot \vec{v}_2 + \ldots + 0 \cdot \vec{v}_k = \vec{0}$.

2. **Closure Under Addition**: Your argument for closure under addition is correct in essence, but you should be careful with notation.

However, there are some issues in your reasoning and presentation:

1. **Terminology and Clarity**: You refer to the ""counter positive,"" but the correct term is ""contrapositive."" Also, your statement of the contrapositive is not entirely clear. The contrapositive of the original statement should be: ""If there exists a vector in the span of $ S $ that can be written as a linear combination of $ S $ in only one way, then $ S $ is linearly independent.""

2. **Logical Structure**: You need to clearly establish the contrapositive statement and then prove it. Your proof should start by assuming that there exists a vector $ \vec{w} \in \operatorname{span}(S) $ that can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of vectors in $ S $. Then, you should show that this implies $ S $ is linearly independent.

3. **Use of Definitions**: You correctly use the definition of linear independence, but your explanation could be clearer. When you state that $ \vec{w} = c_1 \vec{v}_1 + c_2 \vec{v}_2 + \ldots + c_k \vec{v}_k $ and $ \vec{w} = d_1 \vec{v}_1 + d_2 \vec{v}_2 + \ldots + d_k \vec{v}_k $, and since these are the same vector, you correctly conclude that $ c_i = d_i $ for all $ i $.

4. **Conclusion**: You correctly conclude that since the contrapositive is true, the original statement is true. However, make sure to clearly state that you have shown the contrapositive to be true, which implies the original statement is true.

The student should explicitly use the fact that the set is linearly dependent to find two ways of writing a general vector in the span.","Your proof contains some misunderstandings about linear dependence and how linear combinations work. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Definition of Linear Dependence**: A set $ S $ is linearly dependent if there exists a nontrivial linear combination of its vectors that equals the zero vector. This means there are scalars, not all zero, such that a linear combination of the vectors in $ S $ equals the zero vector. This does not directly imply that any vector in the span of $ S $ can be written in more than one way.

2. **Writing $\vec{w}$ as a Linear Combination**: You mention writing $\vec{w}$ by setting all other coefficients to zero and $\vec{w}$ to one. However, $\vec{w}$ is not necessarily an element of $ S$; it is a vector in the span of $ S$. The span of $ S$ includes all possible linear combinations of vectors in $ S$, not just the vectors themselves.

3. **Non-uniqueness of Representation**: The fact that $ S $ is linearly dependent means there is at least one nontrivial way to express the zero vector as a linear combination of vectors in $ S$. This property can be used to show that if $\vec{w}$ is in the span of $ S$, then there might be multiple ways to express $\vec{w}$ as a linear combination of vectors in $ S$. However, your proof does not clearly establish this connection.

4. **Logical Flow**: The proof lacks a clear logical flow and does not explicitly construct two different linear combinations for a general $\vec{w}$ in $\operatorname{span}(S)$. You need to demonstrate explicitly how the linear dependence of $ S $ leads to multiple representations of $\vec{w}$.

In summary, your proof needs a clearer explanation of how linear dependence leads to multiple representations of vectors in the span of $ S$.

However, there are several issues with your proof:

1. **Row Operations**: The row operations you performed are not correct. Specifically, the transition from the first matrix to the second matrix is incorrect. You seem to have multiplied the second row by $a$, but you should be performing row operations that maintain the equivalence of the system. Typically, you would use row operations to eliminate variables systematically, such as using row addition or subtraction to create zeros below the pivot positions.

2. **Matrix Notation**: The notation and steps in your matrix transformations are not clear. It's important to clearly indicate each row operation you perform, such as row swaps, row multiplications, or row additions/subtractions.

3. **Uniqueness Theorem**: While you mention the Uniqueness Theorem, your explanation is not entirely clear. The theorem you are referring to is likely related to the invertibility of the coefficient matrix. For a $2 \times 2$ system, the determinant of the coefficient matrix $\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$ is $ad - bc$. If this determinant is non-zero, the matrix is invertible, and the system has a unique solution.

4. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion about the pivot in the right-most column when $ad - bc = 0$ is not clearly justified. If $ad - bc = 0$, the system may have either no solutions or infinitely many solutions, depending on the consistency of the equations.

1. **Inductive Hypothesis and Inductive Step**: You correctly identify the base case and verify it. However, the inductive step is not clearly structured. You should explicitly state the inductive hypothesis, which is assuming that the statement is true for some positive integer $ k $, i.e., $(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + k)^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + k^3$.

2. **Transition from $ k $ to $ k+1 $**: You need to clearly show how the expression for $ (1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + k + (k+1))^2 $ relates to the expression for $ (1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + k)^2 $. Specifically, you should use the formula for the sum of the first $ n $ integers, $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, to express both sides of the equation for $ k+1 $.

3. **Algebraic Manipulation**: The algebraic steps in your proof are not clearly justified or correct.

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Matrix Representation**: You correctly start by representing the system of equations in matrix form. However, the next step where you set the coefficient matrix equal to the identity matrix is incorrect. The identity matrix is a specific matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, and it cannot be equated to the given matrix unless $a = 1$, $b = 0$, $c = 0$, and $d = 1$, which is not generally true.

2. **Row Reduction**: The process of row reducing the matrix to find a solution is not correctly described. The goal is to transform the matrix into reduced row echelon form (RREF), but the matrix you provided as the result of this process is incorrect. The RREF of a $2 \times 2$ matrix with a non-zero determinant should be the identity matrix, not the matrix you wrote.

3. **Determinant Condition**: The condition $ad - bc \neq 0$ is crucial because it ensures that the matrix is invertible, which implies that the system has a unique solution. This is because a non-zero determinant indicates that the rows (or columns) of the matrix are linearly independent, allowing for a unique solution.

4. **Pivot Points**: Your mention of pivot points is not clearly connected to the argument. In a $2 \times 2$ system, having two pivot positions (one in each row) in the RREF is what indicates a unique solution, but this should be shown through correct row operations.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion that the system has a unique solution should be based on the fact that the determinant is non-zero, which implies the matrix is invertible, and thus the system has a unique solution.

The proof should focus on these conditions rather than just stating that $ n $ and $ m $ are integers.

2. **Subset Proofs**: To show $ S = T $, you need to prove both $ S \subseteq T $ and $ T \subseteq S $. This involves taking an arbitrary element from one set and showing it satisfies the condition to be in the other set. Your proof does not address this process.

2. **Subspace Criteria**: To show that $ H \cap K $ is a subspace of $ V $, you need to verify that it satisfies the three subspace criteria:
   - The zero vector of $ V $ is in $ H \cap K $.
   - $ H \cap K $ is closed under vector addition.
   - $ H \cap K $ is closed under scalar multiplication.

3. **Zero Vector**: You should explicitly state that since both $ H $ and $ K $ are subspaces, they both contain the zero vector of $ V $. Therefore, the zero vector is in $ H \cap K $.

4. **Closure Under Addition and Scalar Multiplication**: You need to show that if $ \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in H \cap K $, then $ \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \in H \cap K $ and if $ c $ is a scalar, then $ c\mathbf{u} \in H \cap K $. This follows because $ \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in H $ and $ \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in K $, and both $ H $ and $ K $ are closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

1. **Base Case**: You correctly identified the base case as $ n = 1 $ and showed that $ 4 \mid (5^1 - 1) = 4 $, which is true. However, for completeness, you should also consider the base case $ n = 0 $ since the problem statement asks for all nonnegative integers. For $ n = 0 $, you need to show that $ 4 \mid (5^0 - 1) = 4 \mid 0 $, which is also true.

2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: You correctly state the inductive hypothesis as $ 4 \mid (5^n - 1) $. However, you need to clearly state what this means: there exists an integer $ k $ such that $ 5^n - 1 = 4k $.

3. **Inductive Step**: You need to prove that if the statement is true for $ n $, then it is true for $ n+1 $. You should start by expressing $ 5^{n+1} - 1 $ in terms of $ 5^n $ and use the inductive hypothesis. Specifically, you should show that:
   $$
   5^{n+1} - 1 = 5 \cdot 5^n - 1 = 5(5^n) - 1 = 5(5^n - 1) + 4
   $$
   Since $ 5^n - 1 = 4k $ by the inductive hypothesis, substitute this into the equation:
   $$
   5(5^n - 1) + 4 = 5(4k) + 4 = 20k + 4 = 4(5k + 1)
   $$
   This shows that $ 5^{n+1} - 1 $ is divisible by 4, completing the inductive step.

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Logical Structure and Clarity**: The proof lacks a clear logical structure. When proving a set containment, you should start by assuming an arbitrary element from the set on the left side of the containment and show that it belongs to the set on the right side.

2. **Misuse of Variables**: You use the variable $ x $ inconsistently. In the context of Cartesian products, you should be considering ordered pairs, not single elements. For example, if you are considering an element of $ A \times (B \cup C) $, it should be an ordered pair $ (a, y) $ where $ a \in A $ and $ y \in B \cup C $.

3. **Definition of Union**: You incorrectly state that if $ x \in B \cup C $, then $ x \in B $ and $ x \in C $. This is incorrect; $ x \in B \cup C $ means $ x \in B $ or $ x \in C $.

4. **Cartesian Product**: The definition of the Cartesian product is not used correctly. For $ A \times (B \cup C) $, an element is of the form $ (a, y) $ where $ a \in A $ and $ y \in B \cup C $.

3. **Closure Under Addition**: Your explanation for closure under addition is correct, but it could be more precise. You should explicitly state that if $U$ and $V$ are symmetric, then $(U+V)^T = U^T + V^T = U + V$, which shows that $U+V$ is symmetric.

2. **Redundancy in Set Notation**: You write $S \cup \{\vec{u}\} = \{\vec{u}, \vec{u}, \vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \ldots, \vec{v}_k\}$. Sets do not include duplicate elements, so this notation is incorrect. The correct set is $S \cup \{\vec{u}\} = \{\vec{u}, \vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \ldots, \vec{v}_k\}$.

To show linear dependence, you need to demonstrate that there exists a nontrivial linear combination of the vectors in $S \cup \{\vec{u}\}$ that equals the zero vector. Since $\vec{u}$ is a linear combination of the vectors in $S$, you can express $\vec{u}$ as $a_1\vec{v}_1 + a_2\vec{v}_2 + \ldots + a_k\vec{v}_k$.

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Zero Vector/Matrix**: In the context of matrices, the ""zero vector"" is actually the zero matrix, which is the matrix where all entries are zero. For the space $ M_{n \times n} $, the zero matrix is the $ n \times n $ matrix with all entries equal to zero. This matrix is symmetric, as it is equal to its own transpose. Therefore, the zero matrix is indeed in $ \operatorname{Sym}_{n \times n} $.

2. **Subspace Criteria**: To show that a subset $ H $ of a vector space $ V $ is a subspace, you need to verify three properties:
   - The zero vector of $ V $ is in $ H $.
   - $ H $ is closed under addition.
   - $ H $ is closed under scalar multiplication.

   You only attempted to address the first property, and your reasoning was incorrect. You need to check all three properties to determine if $ \operatorname{Sym}_{n \times n} $ is a subspace.

1. **Misinterpretation of Linear Dependence**: You correctly state that a set $ S $ is linearly dependent if there exists a nontrivial linear combination of its vectors that equals the zero vector. However, this does not directly imply that every vector in $\operatorname{span}(S)$ can be written in more than one way.

3. **Conclusion**: The conclusion that there must be another solution to the linear combination besides the trivial one is not adequately supported. You need to explicitly show how the existence of a nontrivial combination for the zero vector leads to multiple representations for $\vec{w}$.

1. **Misinterpretation of Linear Independence**: You state that if a set is linearly independent, the only vector that can be written as a linear combination from $ S $ is the zero vector.

Your statement of the contrapositive is not accurate.

3. **Incorrect Assumptions**: You assume that because $ S $ is linearly dependent, there are at least two different linear combinations that equal the zero vector.

2. **Direction $\Leftarrow$:** You begin by assuming $ A $ is invertible and aim to show $ T $ is one-to-one. You start with $ T(\vec{x}) = T(\vec{y}) $ and need to show $ \vec{x} = \vec{y} $. You should use the fact that if $ A $ is invertible, then $ A\vec{x} = A\vec{y} $ implies $ \vec{x} = \vec{y} $ because you can multiply both sides by $ A^{-1} $.

   - The mention of ""free variables"" is more relevant to systems of linear equations rather than the abstract setting of linear transformations. It would be better to focus on the properties of the transformation itself.

3. **Backward Direction ($\Leftarrow$)**:
   - Your argument is not clearly articulated. You need to show that if $T$ is one-to-one, then the only vector that maps to the zero vector is the zero vector itself, i.e., $\operatorname{null}(T) = \{\overrightarrow{0}\}$.
   - The statement ""we must show that $f(a)=f(0)$"" is unclear and seems to confuse the roles of $a$ and $0$. Instead, you should argue that if $T(\vec{x}) = \overrightarrow{0}$ implies $\vec{x} = \overrightarrow{0}$, then the null space is trivial.

It would be clearer to explicitly state that this is for all possible choices of $ a_i $, not just a single choice. This is a minor point, but clarity is important in proofs.

1. You correctly start by assuming the negation of the theorem: there exists an integer $ n $ such that 4 divides $ n^2 + 2 $.

2. You then state that there must be some integer $ a $ such that $ 4a = n^2 + 2 $. This is correct.

3. Rearranging gives $ n^2 = 2(2a - 1) $, which implies $ n^2 $ is even, and therefore $ n $ is even. This is also correct.

4. You let $ n = 2b $ for some integer $ b $, and substitute to get $ 2(2a - 1) = (2b)^2 = 4b^2 $.

5. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $ 2a - 1 = 2b^2 $.

6. Here is where the issue arises: you conclude that an odd integer equals an even integer, which is a contradiction. However, the contradiction arises because $ 2a - 1 $ is odd (since it is of the form $ 2 \times \text{integer} - 1 $), while $ 2b^2 $ is even (since it is $ 2 \times \text{integer} $). 

The contradiction is indeed that an odd number cannot equal an even number, but it would be clearer to explicitly state that $ 2a - 1 $ is odd and $ 2b^2 $ is even, leading to the contradiction.

While it's true that the specific order of columns doesn't affect the rank-nullity relationship, the phrase ""without loss of generality"" is typically used when a specific choice doesn't affect the generality of the argument. Here, it's more about the nature of the row-reduced form rather than a choice you're making, so it might be clearer to simply state that the first $ k $ columns are pivot columns after row reduction.

2. **Explanation of Pivot Columns and Column Space:** You correctly state that the pivot columns of a matrix generate its column space, but it's important to note that this is true for the original matrix $ A $ and not just its row-reduced form. The pivot columns of the row-reduced form correspond to a basis for the column space of $ A $, but they are not necessarily the same columns in $ A $.

3. **Basis for Null Space:** When you describe the parameterization of the null space, you correctly identify the free variables and express the solution in terms of them. However, ensure that the vectors you describe as $\vec{w}, \ldots, \vec{u}$ are clearly defined as the basis vectors for the null space. It's important to emphasize that these vectors are linearly independent and span the null space.

1. **Misinterpretation of $ ad - bc \neq 0 $:** The condition $ ad - bc \neq 0 $ is the determinant of the coefficient matrix of the system. This condition directly implies that the matrix is invertible, which guarantees a unique solution. Your proof does not clearly connect this determinant condition to the invertibility of the matrix.

3. **Row Operations and Pivot Variables:** Your description of the row operations and the identification of pivot variables is not accurate. The pivot variables are determined by the leading coefficients in each row after row reduction, not by the original coefficients $ a $ and $ d - mb $.

4. **Uniqueness Theorem Misapplication:** The Uniqueness Theorem you refer to is not clearly stated or applied correctly. The key point is that the system has a unique solution if the coefficient matrix is invertible, which is equivalent to having a non-zero determinant.

However, your wording ""within each of them, there must exist an element $ \vec{u}+\vec{v} $"" is a bit awkward.

However, it would be helpful to explicitly state that a nontrivial linear combination means that not all coefficients are zero.

2. **Choice of Coefficients**: You set $ a_i = c_i $ for $ i \leq k $ and $ a_{k+1} = -1 $. While this works, it might be clearer to emphasize that you are constructing a specific nontrivial linear combination to demonstrate dependence. The choice of $ a_i = c_i $ is valid because $ \vec{u} $ is already expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in $ S $.

   - The notation ""im(T)"" is used for the image of T, which is fine, but ensure consistency with ""Col(A)"" as they represent the same concept in this context.

   - In the (1) $\Rightarrow$ part, you mention ""Theorem 3.35"" and ""Theorem 4.13"" without specifying what these theorems state. While it's understood that these are likely from your textbook, it would be clearer to briefly state the relevant parts of these theorems.
   - When discussing the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of A, you mention that ""every $A_{ij}$ where $i=j$ must equal 0,"" which seems to be a typo. You likely meant that every $A_{ij}$ where $i=j$ must equal 1 in the identity matrix.

3. **Logical Gaps**:
   - In the (1) $\Leftarrow$ part, you assume that if $A$ is invertible, then its columns are linearly independent, which is correct. However, your argument about linear dependence leading to a contradiction could be more direct. You don't need to assume linear dependence and derive a contradiction; you can directly state that invertibility implies linear independence.

2. **Convex Combination**: You attempted to use a convex combination $c\vec{u} + (1-c)\vec{v}$ to show that there are infinitely many solutions. However, this approach is flawed because it does not generally hold that $A(c\vec{u} + (1-c)\vec{v}) = \vec{b}$ for all $c$. This property only holds if the system is homogeneous (i.e., $\vec{b} = \vec{0}$).

3. **Correct Approach**: The correct reasoning involves understanding that if a linear system has two distinct solutions, then the difference $\vec{u} - \vec{v}$ is a non-zero solution to the associated homogeneous system $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$.

The rank of $ A $ is indeed the dimension of the column space of $ A $, which is the same as the dimension of the image of $ T $. The nullity of $ A $ is the dimension of the kernel of $ T $, which is the subspace of $ \mathbb{R}^n $ consisting of all vectors $ \vec{x} $ such that $ A\vec{x} = \vec{0} $.

3. **Pivot Columns**: You mention columns with pivots and those without, but your explanation is somewhat vague. The rank of $ A $ is the number of pivot columns in the row-reduced form of $ A $, and the nullity is the number of free variables, which corresponds to the number of non-pivot columns.

2. You then deduce that $ n^2 + 2 $ is even, which is true, but this step is not necessary for the proof. The key point is that $ n^2 + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} $.

3. You correctly substitute $ n = 2k $ to express $ n $ as an even integer, leading to $ n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 $.

4. You then have $ 4 \mid 4k^2 + 2 $, which simplifies to $ 4k^2 + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} $.

5. The critical step is to note that $ 4k^2 + 2 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} $, not $ 0 \pmod{4} $. This is the contradiction, as $ 4k^2 + 2 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} $ cannot be congruent to $ 0 \pmod{4} $.

The contradiction arises because $ 4k^2 + 2 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} $ cannot be divisible by 4, which contradicts the assumption that $ 4 \mid n^2 + 2 $. Therefore, your proof is correct in its conclusion, but it could be clearer in explicitly stating the contradiction in terms of modular arithmetic.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0

1. **Induction Hypothesis Clarification**: You should clearly state the induction hypothesis. You correctly use the induction hypothesis, but it would be clearer if you explicitly stated it as: ""Assume that for some positive integer $ k $, $(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + k)^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + k^3$.""

2. **Base Case**: You correctly verify the base case for $ n = 1 $.

3. **Transition from $ n = k $ to $ n = k+1 $**: You correctly set up the expression for $ (1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + (k+1))^2 $ and use the induction hypothesis. However, you should ensure that each step is clearly justified, especially when substituting the formula for the sum of the first $ k $ integers, $\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.

4. **Conclusion**: You conclude correctly by showing that if the statement holds for $ n = k $, it also holds for $ n = k+1 $. However, you should explicitly state that by the principle of mathematical induction, the theorem holds for all positive integers $ n $.

It's important to be clear that $T$ is the transformation and $A$ is the matrix representing it. When you refer to $\operatorname{Col}(T)$ and $\operatorname{Null}(T)$, it would be more precise to refer to $\operatorname{Col}(A)$ and $\operatorname{Null}(A)$, as these are the column space and null space of the matrix $A$.

2. **Dimension of the Column Space**: You correctly state that the rank of $T$ (or $A$) is the dimension of the column space of $A$. However, you should explicitly state that this is the number of pivot columns in the row-reduced form of $A$.

3. **Dimension of the Null Space**: You mention that the nullity is the dimension of the null space, which is correct. However, you should clarify that this corresponds to the number of free variables in the system $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$.

4. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion is a bit unclear. You should explicitly state that the rank-nullity theorem tells us that the sum of the rank and nullity of a linear transformation (or matrix) equals the number of columns of the matrix, which is $n$ in this case.

1. **Row Reduction to Identity Matrix**: You correctly state that if $ A $ is invertible, it can be row reduced to the identity matrix $ I_n $. This implies that $ A $ has full rank, meaning it has $ n $ pivots. However, you should explicitly connect this to the fact that the row reduction process corresponds to multiplying by elementary matrices, which are invertible, thus preserving the invertibility of $ A $.

2. **Linearly Independent Columns**: You mention that $ A $ is linearly independent. It's more precise to say that the columns of $ A $ are linearly independent, which is a consequence of $ A $ being invertible. This ensures that the null space of $ A $ contains only the zero vector, which is crucial for the uniqueness of solutions.

3. **Uniqueness of Solutions**: You conclude that $ A \vec{x} = \vec{b} $ has a unique solution for every $ \vec{b} $.

1. **Incorrect Definition of Inverse**: You start by assuming that $B = (A^T)^{-1}$ and then state that $B A^T = I_n$ and $A^T B = I_n$. However, you haven't established that $B$ is indeed the inverse of $A^T$. The definition of an inverse requires you to show that there exists a matrix $B$ such that both $B A^T = I_n$ and $A^T B = I_n$. You cannot assume $B = (A^T)^{-1}$ without proving it.

1. **Matrix Row Operations**: The row operations you performed on the augmented matrix are not clearly justified or correctly executed. For example, the transition from the first matrix to the second matrix is not a valid row operation. You seem to be dividing rows by elements that could potentially be zero, which is not allowed without justification that these elements are non-zero.

2. **Pivot Positions**: You mention that the augmented matrix has $n$ pivot entries, but you do not clearly identify or justify these pivot positions. The concept of pivot positions is crucial in determining the uniqueness of solutions, but your proof does not adequately address this.

3. **Consistency and Uniqueness**: You state that the system is consistent because $ad - bc \neq 0$, but you do not explain why this determinant condition implies consistency. The condition $ad - bc \neq 0$ actually ensures that the coefficient matrix is invertible, which implies both consistency and uniqueness of the solution. However, this reasoning is not clearly articulated in your proof.

4. **Theorem Misstatement**: The theorem you reference about the number of pivot entries and the rightmost column is not accurately stated. The correct condition for a unique solution is that the coefficient matrix (not the augmented matrix) must have full rank, which is equivalent to having a non-zero determinant in the case of a $2 \times 2$ system.

   - You wrote $ AB^T = \left[\left(\sum_{k=1}^m a_{jk} b_{ki}\right)_{ij}\right]_{p \times n} $, which is incorrect. This expression does not represent the transpose of $ AB $. Instead, it seems like you are trying to express $ (AB)^T $ but with incorrect indices and summation.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To show $ (AB)^T = B^T A^T $, you should start by expressing the element of $ (AB)^T $ at position $ (j, i) $ as the element of $ AB $ at position $ (i, j) $, which is $ \sum_{k=1}^m a_{ik} b_{kj} $.
   - Then, show that this is equal to the element of $ B^T A^T $ at position $ (j, i) $, which is $ \sum_{k=1}^m b_{jk} a_{ki} $.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Your conclusion is correct, but the steps leading to it need to be revised to accurately reflect the properties of matrix transposition and multiplication.

However, when you write $\vec{x} = \overrightarrow{0} - \vec{u}$ and $\vec{y} = \overrightarrow{0} - \vec{u}$, you are implicitly using the property that the zero vector is the additive identity, which is fine, but it would be clearer to explicitly state that $\overrightarrow{0} - \vec{u} = -\vec{u}$, where $-\vec{u}$ is the additive inverse of $\vec{u}$.

2. **Equality of $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$**: You conclude that $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ are equal because they are both equal to $\overrightarrow{0} - \vec{u}$. This is correct, but it would be clearer to explicitly state that since both $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ satisfy the same equation, they must be equal by the definition of equality in a vector space.

3. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion is correct, but it would be stronger if you explicitly stated that since $\vec{x} = \vec{y}$, the additive inverse of $\vec{u}$ is unique.

1. **Linear Dependence Definition**: You correctly start by stating that $ S $ is linearly dependent, which means there exist scalars $ c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k $, not all zero, such that $ c_1 \vec{v}_1 + c_2 \vec{v}_2 + \ldots + c_k \vec{v}_k = \vec{0} $.

The next step is where the error occurs. You expanded the terms as:
$$

However, when you expanded and combined the terms, you made a mistake:
$$

Combine the terms correctly:

Now, factor the expression:
$$

This matches the expression for $(k+1)((k+1)+1)(2(k+1)+1)/6$:

However, it would be clearer to explicitly state that you are assuming $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are both additive inverses of $\vec{u}$, meaning $\vec{u} + \vec{a} = \vec{0}$ and $\vec{u} + \vec{b} = \vec{0}$, where $\vec{0}$ is the zero vector.

2. **Use of Subtraction**: You mention ""subtracting $\vec{u}$ on both sides"" to conclude $\vec{a} = \vec{b}$. In vector spaces, subtraction is typically defined in terms of addition and the additive inverse. Instead of saying ""subtracting $\vec{u}$,"" you could say ""adding the additive inverse of $\vec{u}$ to both sides"" to align with the operations defined in vector spaces.

1. **Incorrect Use of Induction**: The proof attempts to use mathematical induction, but the structure is incorrect.

Your base case is for $ n = 1 $, but you need to specify the set of numbers you are proving the statement for. If you are proving it for all integers, you need to consider negative integers as well.

2. **Induction Hypothesis Misuse**: In your induction hypothesis, you assume $ S_{k+1} $ is true, which is not the correct approach. You should assume $ S_k $ is true (i.e., assume the statement holds for $ n = k $) and then prove $ S_{k+1} $.

You should have explained why c+3a is an integer by citing the fact that the integers are closed under multiplication and addition.,"Your proof attempts to show the equivalence between two statements: that 3 divides a two-digit number $ n $ and that 3 divides the sum of its digits. However, there are several issues with your proof that need to be addressed:

1. **Structure and Clarity**: The proof lacks a clear structure. Typically, for an ""if and only if"" proof, you should clearly separate the two directions: proving ""if"" and proving ""only if"". Your proof mixes these directions, which makes it difficult to follow.

2. **Use of Variables**: You introduce variables $ c $ and $ d $ to represent the divisibility conditions, but the transitions between these variables and the original expressions are not clearly justified. For example, you state that $ 3c = a + b $ and $ 3d = n $, but the connection between these and the original problem is not clearly established.

3. **Axiom of Closure**: You mention the ""Axiom of Closure"" in a way that is not standard in proofs of this nature. The closure property typically refers to operations within a set (e.g., integers are closed under addition), but your use of it to justify substituting variables is not appropriate.

4. **Contradiction Argument**: The contradiction part of your proof is not clearly articulated. You assume $ 3 \mid n $ but $ 3 \nmid a + b $, and then derive $ 3(c - 3a) = a + b $. However, the conclusion that $ a + b $ is both an integer and not an integer is not valid. The contradiction should be more directly related to the properties of divisibility.

5. **Logical Flow**: The logical flow of the proof is not smooth. You jump between different parts of the argument without clear transitions or justifications, which makes it hard to follow the reasoning.

To improve your proof, consider the following:

- Clearly separate the two directions of the proof: show that if 3 divides $ n $, then it divides $ a + b $, and vice versa.
- Use clear and consistent notation, and ensure that each step logically follows from the previous one.
- Avoid unnecessary or incorrect use of mathematical terms, such as the ""Axiom of Closure"" in this context.
- Ensure that your contradiction argument is valid and directly addresses the problem statement.

However, you mention $ m+n = al $ without initially defining $ l $. It would be clearer to state that you are trying to show $ m+n = al $ for some integer $ l $.

A system of linear equations typically involves multiple equations, not just one. The proof should consider a system with at least two equations to demonstrate the existence of infinitely many solutions.

3. **Linear Combination**: The proof attempts to show that a linear combination of two solutions is also a solution. This is a correct approach, but the explanation is not clear.

1. **Base Case:** You correctly verified the base case for $ n = 1 $.

2. **Induction Hypothesis:** You correctly assume that the formula holds for some $ k $, i.e., $\sum_{i=1}^k i = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.

3. **Induction Step:** You need to show that $\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}$.

   - You start with $\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i = \sum_{i=1}^k i + (k+1)$.
   - By the induction hypothesis, $\sum_{i=1}^k i = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.
   - Therefore, $\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1)$.

1. **Structure and Clarity**:

   - When you assume $T$ is one-to-one, you correctly aim to show that $A\vec{x} = 0$ has only the trivial solution. However, your argument about $a, b \in \operatorname{null}(A)$ is a bit confusing. Instead, directly show that if $A\vec{x} = 0$ and $T$ is one-to-one, then $\vec{x}$ must be the zero vector.
   - When proving the converse (if $A$ is invertible, then $T$ is one-to-one), your argument is mostly correct, but make sure to clearly state that since $A$ is invertible, $A\vec{x} = 0$ implies $\vec{x} = 0$, which is the definition of one-to-one.

3. **Proof of Invertible if and only if Onto**:

1. **Matrix Row Operations**: The operations you performed to transform the matrix are not valid row operations.

2. **Membership in Sets**: You need to show that every element in $ S $ is in $ T $ and vice versa to prove $ S = T $. This involves showing that if $ n = 5k + 2 $, then there exists an integer $ j $ such that $ n = 5j - 3 $, and similarly for the reverse.

3. **Logical Steps**: Your proof does not provide a logical argument for why every element in $ S $ is in $ T $ and vice versa. You need to demonstrate the equivalence of the forms $ 5k + 2 $ and $ 5j - 3 $ by finding a relationship between $ k $ and $ j $.

1. **Parameterization of Solutions**: The parameterization you used, $\frac{1}{n} \vec{u} + \frac{n-1}{n} \vec{v}$, is not correct for showing that there are infinitely many solutions. The correct parameterization for a line through two distinct solutions $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ is $\vec{x} = t\vec{u} + (1-t)\vec{v}$ for $t \in \mathbb{R}$. This parameterization shows that for each $t$, $\vec{x}$ is a solution, and since $t$ can take infinitely many values, there are infinitely many solutions.

2. **Use of Natural Numbers**: You mentioned $n \in \mathbb{N}$, but the parameter $n$ should not be restricted to natural numbers. The parameter $t$ in the correct parameterization can be any real number, which is crucial for demonstrating the existence of infinitely many solutions.

3. **Linearity Misstep**: The step where you split $A\left(\frac{1}{n} \vec{u}+\frac{n-1}{n} \vec{v}\right)$ into two separate terms assumes linearity correctly, but the choice of coefficients does not cover all possible solutions. The correct approach is to show that any linear combination of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ that satisfies the equation forms a line of solutions.

The null space is never the empty set; it always contains at least the zero vector. The nullity is zero if and only if the null space contains only the zero vector.

   - The expression ""$\frac{\overrightarrow{2}}{2} u$"" seems to be a typographical error. It should be ""$\frac{1}{2} \vec{u}$.""

2. **Correctness**:
   - You correctly identify that if $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are solutions, then any linear combination $t\vec{u} + (1-t)\vec{v}$ is also a solution. However, you need to explicitly state that this is because $A(t\vec{u} + (1-t)\vec{v}) = tA\vec{u} + (1-t)A\vec{v} = t\vec{b} + (1-t)\vec{b} = \vec{b}$.
   - You should clarify that the existence of two distinct solutions implies that the system is homogeneous (i.e., $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$) or that the solutions form an affine space, which is why linear combinations of solutions are also solutions.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - You correctly conclude that there are infinitely many solutions, but it would be helpful to explicitly state that this is because $t$ can take any real value, leading to infinitely many distinct solutions.

2. **Free Variables**: You mention ""free variables"" in the context of linear combinations, which is not the standard terminology. Free variables are typically discussed in the context of solving systems of linear equations. In the context of linear independence, you should focus on whether the coefficients in the linear combination are unique.

3. **Non-Trivial Linear Combination**: You mention ""not a trivial linear combination"" but do not clearly define what you mean. A non-trivial linear combination is one where not all coefficients are zero. You should clarify this in your argument.

5. **Logical Flow**: The logical flow of your proof is not clear. You need to explicitly show that if a vector can be written as a linear combination in more than one way, then there must be a non-trivial linear combination of the vectors in $S$ that equals the zero vector, which implies linear dependence.

1. **Contradiction Setup**: You start by stating the ""contradiction of statement"" incorrectly. The correct approach is to assume the opposite of what you want to prove: assume $ r $ is rational and show this leads to a contradiction.

2. **Rational Representation**: You correctly assume $ r = \frac{m}{n} $ with $ m, n \in \mathbb{Z} $ and $ n \neq 0 $, but you should also assume that $ m $ and $ n $ are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). This is crucial for the proof.

3. **Algebraic Manipulation**: You correctly derive $ m^2 = 2n^2 $. However, the next step is not to take the square root. Instead, you should analyze the implications of this equation. Specifically, $ m^2 = 2n^2 $ implies $ m^2 $ is even, which means $ m $ must be even (since the square of an odd number is odd).

4. **Evenness Argument**: If $ m $ is even, then $ m = 2k $ for some integer $ k $. Substituting back, you get $ (2k)^2 = 2n^2 $, which simplifies to $ 4k^2 = 2n^2 $ or $ 2k^2 = n^2 $. This implies $ n^2 $ is even, so $ n $ must also be even.

5. **Contradiction**: If both $ m $ and $ n $ are even, they have a common factor of 2, contradicting the assumption that $ m $ and $ n $ are coprime.

Your proof incorrectly states the negation as involving ""every $ n \in \mathbb{Z} $,"" which is not correct.

2. **Onto and Invertibility:**
   - In the second part of your proof, you correctly state that if $ A $ is invertible, then its columns form a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$, which implies $ T $ is onto.

4. **Contradiction Argument**: The contradiction argument is based on incorrect matrix manipulations. The steps you provided do not logically lead to the conclusion that there is a contradiction.

Also, subspaces don't have their own zero vectors; they share the zero vector of the larger vector space $V$.

2. **Zero Vector**: You correctly note that the zero vector of $V$ is in both $H$ and $K$, but the reasoning is a bit off. The zero vector is in $H \cap K$ because it is in both $H$ and $K$, not because $H$ and $K$ have the ""same zero vector.""

   - Instead, you should focus on the fact that if $T$ is one-to-one, then the only solution to $T(\vec{a}) = \overrightarrow{0}$ must be $\vec{a} = \overrightarrow{0}$.

2. **Misinterpretation of Linear Combinations**: You seem to suggest that because $ S $ is linearly dependent, any vector $ \vec{w} $ in the span of $ S $ can be expressed in more than one way.

The existence of a nontrivial linear combination for the zero vector does not automatically provide multiple representations for other vectors in the span.

1. **Matrix Operations**: The operations you performed on the matrix are not valid elementary row operations. For example, multiplying rows by other rows or combining them in the way you did is not allowed. Elementary row operations include swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar, and adding a multiple of one row to another.

2. **Row Echelon Form (REF)**: The matrix you claim to be in row echelon form is not correctly derived. The process of obtaining REF involves using valid elementary row operations to create zeros below the pivots, not arbitrary operations.

3. **Determinant and Uniqueness**: The condition $ ad - bc \neq 0 $ is indeed related to the uniqueness of the solution, but it is because this determinant being non-zero implies that the coefficient matrix is invertible. This means the system has a unique solution, not because of the specific REF you derived.

4. **Solution Expressions**: The expressions you provided for $ x_1 $ and $ x_2 $ are incorrect. The correct expressions should be derived from solving the system using valid methods, such as substitution or using the inverse of the coefficient matrix.

5. **Pivots and Columns**: The statement about pivots not being in the right column is not relevant in the context of determining uniqueness. The key is that the coefficient matrix is invertible (non-zero determinant), which ensures a unique solution.

   - Clearly define all variables at the beginning. You introduced $a$ and $b$ as the tens and ones digits, respectively, but it would be helpful to state this explicitly.

2. **Structure and Logic**:
   - In the ""Backwards Implication"" section, you correctly show that $10a$ and $a$ have the same remainder when divided by 3. However, you should explicitly state that this implies $10a + b$ and $a + b$ have the same remainder when divided by 3, which is the crux of the argument.

2. **Divisibility Argument**: You attempt to use the fact that one of the numbers in the sequence $ n, n+1, n+2 $ is divisible by 3. This is a valid approach, but it is not clearly or correctly applied in your proof. You should focus on showing that one of these three consecutive integers is divisible by 3, which implies that their product is divisible by 3.

**Direction 2** has an error. You need to show that if 3 divides the sum of the digits $ a + b $, then 3 divides $ n = 10a + b $.

1. **Range of $ p $:** In both directions, you state that $ 0 \leq p \leq 10 $. However, since $ n $ is a two-digit number, $ p $ should actually be in the range $ 0 \leq p \leq 9 $. This is because $ p $ represents the units digit of $ n $.

2. **Axiom of Closure:** You mention the ""Axiom of Closure"" when stating that certain expressions are integers. While it's true that the set of integers is closed under addition and subtraction, this is a basic property of integers and doesn't need to be explicitly stated as an axiom in this context. It's sufficient to note that since $ m $ and $ a $ are integers, expressions like $ m - 3a $ and $ m + 3a $ are also integers.

1. **Simplification of the Fraction**: You correctly start by assuming that $ r = \frac{x}{y} $ is in its simplest form, meaning $ x $ and $ y $ have no common factors other than 1. However, towards the end, you mention $ r^2 = \frac{2u}{2v} $, which seems to be a misunderstanding. The simplification should be applied to $ r = \frac{x}{y} $, not $ r^2 $.

2. **Final Contradiction**: The contradiction arises from the fact that both $ x $ and $ y $ being even implies they have a common factor of 2, which contradicts the assumption that $ \frac{x}{y} $ is in its simplest form. You should emphasize that this contradiction arises because both $ x $ and $ y $ being even means they share a factor of 2, which contradicts the assumption that they have no common factors.

3. **Equation Handling**: When you substitute $ x = 2u $ and $ y = 2v $, you should focus on the fact that this implies both $ x $ and $ y $ are divisible by 2, which directly contradicts the assumption that $ \frac{x}{y} $ is in its simplest form.

Let's go through your proof:

1. **Even Case**: You correctly assume $ n = 2y $ and substitute it into the expression, leading to $ 2y^2 = 2x - 1 $. You correctly identify that this is a contradiction because the left side is even and the right side is odd.

2. **Odd Case**: You assume $ n = 2z + 1 $ and substitute it into the expression, leading to $ 2(2z^2 + 2z) = 2(2x - 1) - 1 $. You correctly identify that this is a contradiction because the left side is even and the right side is odd.

The oversight is in the simplification of the odd case. When you substitute $ n = 2z + 1 $ into $ n^2 + 2 $, you should get:

$$
n^2 + 2 = (2z + 1)^2 + 2 = 4z^2 + 4z + 1 + 2 = 4z^2 + 4z + 3

2. **Clarity in Definitions**: When you mention ""the definition of invertible described above for Theorem 4.14,"" ensure that this definition is clear and consistent with what is expected in your course.

   - When you refer to the null space, use consistent notation. You switch between $\operatorname{Null}(A)$ and $\operatorname{Null}(T)$, which can be confusing. Stick to one notation.

2. **Logical Flow**:
   - You start by proving that if $A$ is invertible, then $T$ is both one-to-one and onto. This part is mostly clear, but you could emphasize more explicitly that an invertible matrix $A$ implies that the linear transformation $T$ has a unique solution for every $\vec{b}$, which makes it both one-to-one and onto.

   - When you mention that if $T$ is one-to-one, then $\operatorname{Null}(T) = \{\vec{0}\}$, make sure to clarify that this implies $\operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{Null}(A)) = 0$.

4. **Converse Proof**:
   - You mention that if $T$ is onto, then $A$ is invertible, but you don't provide a detailed argument for this. You should explicitly state that if $T$ is onto, then the column space of $A$ spans $\mathbb{R}^n$, which implies that $\operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{Col}(A)) = n$, leading to $A$ being invertible.

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Row Echelon Form (REF) Error**: The transformation of the augmented matrix to row echelon form is incorrect. The matrix you provided does not correctly represent the row echelon form of the original system. Specifically, the first row should not have a leading 1 in the first column unless you divide the entire row by $a$, and the second row should not have a leading 1 in the second column unless you perform specific row operations.

2. **Incorrect Row Operations**: The expression $\frac{i c-a k}{b c-a d}$ in the second row of your matrix is incorrect. The correct row operations to achieve row echelon form involve eliminating the $x_1$ term from the second equation by using a multiple of the first equation, and this should be done carefully to ensure the operations are valid.

3. **Uniqueness Condition**: The uniqueness of the solution is determined by the determinant of the coefficient matrix $\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$.

Your proof should focus on this determinant condition rather than incorrectly transforming the matrix.

1. **Notation and Indices**: The notation you use for matrix elements is inconsistent and incorrect. For example, $A_{ij}$ typically denotes the element in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of matrix $A$, not a row or column itself. Similarly, $B_{mn}$ should denote an element, not a row or column.

2. **Matrix Multiplication**: The expression $A B = A_i B_n$ is not correct. Matrix multiplication involves summing over products of elements from rows of $A$ and columns of $B$. Specifically, the element in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of $AB$ is given by $\sum_k A_{ik} B_{kj}$.

3. **Transpose of a Product**: The statement $(AB)^T = B_n A_i$ is incorrect. The transpose of a product $(AB)^T$ is not simply swapping the order of $A$ and $B$ without considering their elements.

4. **Transpose Notation**: When you write $B^T = B_{nm}$ and $A^T = A_{ji}$, it seems like you are trying to express the transposition, but this notation is not clear. The transpose of a matrix $B$ is a new matrix where the element in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of $B^T$ is $B_{ji}$.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion that $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$ is not justified by the steps you provided. The proof lacks a clear logical flow and does not correctly use the properties of matrix multiplication and transposition.

To improve your proof, focus on the definitions of matrix multiplication and transposition, and use these to show that the element in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of $(AB)^T$ is equal to the element in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of $B^T A^T$.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0

1. **Definition of the Solution Set**: You refer to the solution set as $\vec{x}$, which is confusing because $\vec{x}$ typically denotes a single vector, not a set. It would be clearer to denote the solution set as $S$ or another symbol to indicate it is a set of vectors.

2. **Zero Vector**: You correctly mention that the zero vector must be in the solution set, but your explanation is unclear. You should explicitly state that $A \overrightarrow{0} = \overrightarrow{0}$, which shows that the zero vector is indeed a solution.

3. **Closure Under Addition**: You mention that adding vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ results in a vector with the correct dimensions, but you need to show that $A(\vec{u} + \vec{v}) = A\vec{u} + A\vec{v} = \overrightarrow{0} + \overrightarrow{0} = \overrightarrow{0}$, which demonstrates closure under addition.

4. **Closure Under Scalar Multiplication**: Similarly, you need to show that for any scalar $c \in \mathbb{R}$, $A(c\vec{x}) = cA\vec{x} = c\overrightarrow{0} = \overrightarrow{0}$, which demonstrates closure under scalar multiplication.

5. **Focus on Dimensions**: Your proof focuses too much on the dimensions of the vectors rather than the properties of the operations involved.

2. **Backward Direction ($\Leftarrow$):**
   - You state that if $T$ is one-to-one, then $\operatorname{null}(T) = \{\overrightarrow{0}\}$. Your explanation is a bit confusing. The correct reasoning is that if $T$ is one-to-one, then the only vector that maps to $\overrightarrow{0}$ under $T$ is $\overrightarrow{0}$ itself. This is because if there were any non-zero vector $\vec{v}$ such that $T(\vec{v}) = \overrightarrow{0}$, then $T$ would not be one-to-one, as both $\vec{v}$ and $\overrightarrow{0}$ would map to the same vector $\overrightarrow{0}$.

However, this does not necessarily mean that $a$ is an integer. $a$ could be any rational number, so the conclusion that $a \mid (n+m)$ is not justified unless $a$ is specifically an integer.

2. **Conclusion about divisibility:** The statement ""we conclude that $a \mid (n+m)$ for all integers $n$ and $m$ if $a$ is an integer such that $a \mid m$ and $a \mid n$"" is not directly supported by your proof. The proof shows that $n+m = a(k+j)$, but for $a$ to divide $n+m$, $k+j$ must be an integer, which is not guaranteed by your setup.

3. **Assumptions about $a$:** You need to explicitly state that $a$ is an integer for the divisibility conclusion to hold. The proof does not establish that $a$ is an integer, only that it is a common factor of $m$ and $n$ when expressed in terms of $k$ and $j$.

4. **Generalization:** The proof seems to attempt to generalize a property of divisibility, but it lacks a clear statement of the conditions under which the property holds. Specifically, you need to clarify that $a$ must be an integer divisor of both $m$ and $n$ for the conclusion to be valid.

1. **Zero Vector in the Span**: You start by trying to show that the zero vector is in the span, but your explanation is unclear.

1. **Definition of Span**: You correctly start by stating that if $\vec{u} \in \operatorname{span}(S)$, then $\vec{u}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of vectors in $S$. However, you then incorrectly state that these linear combinations equal $S$, which is not accurate.

2. **Linear Dependence**: To show that $S \cup \{\vec{u}\}$ is linearly dependent, you need to demonstrate that there exists a nontrivial linear combination of the vectors in $S \cup \{\vec{u}\}$ that equals the zero vector. Since $\vec{u}$ is a linear combination of vectors in $S$, you can write $\vec{u} = a_1\vec{s_1} + a_2\vec{s_2} + \cdots + a_n\vec{s_n}$. Then, the linear combination $-1 \cdot \vec{u} + a_1\vec{s_1} + a_2\vec{s_2} + \cdots + a_n\vec{s_n} = \vec{0}$ is nontrivial (since not all coefficients are zero), showing linear dependence.

3. **Scalar Multiples and Zero Vector**: Your mention of $\vec{u}$ being a scalar multiple of another vector in $S$ or the zero vector is not necessary and can be misleading. The key point is that $\vec{u}$ is expressible as a linear combination of vectors in $S$, which directly leads to the linear dependence of $S \cup \{\vec{u}\}$.

You should specify that if $a \mid m$, then $m = ak$ for some integer $k$, and if $a \mid n$, then $n = aj$ for some integer $j$.

Specifically, a system has a unique solution if the rank of the coefficient matrix equals the number of variables and there is no pivot in the rightmost column of the augmented matrix.

2. **Matrix Representation**: You started with a 2x3 matrix, which suggests a system of two equations with two variables and a constant term. However, you did not clearly define the system of equations or the variables involved. It's important to clearly state the system you are working with.

1. **Misinterpretation of the System**: You start by assuming that the system of equations has two distinct solutions and then claim that one equation is a scalar multiple of the other. However, if one equation is a scalar multiple of the other, the system is dependent and has infinitely many solutions, but this does not directly relate to having exactly two distinct solutions.

2. **Example Provided**: The example you provided, where one equation is a scalar multiple of the other, indeed represents a system with infinitely many solutions. However, the specific solutions you mentioned, $(x_1=10, x_2=0)$ and $(x_1=0, x_2=10)$, are not the only solutions. In fact, any pair $(x_1, x_2)$ such that $x_1 + x_2 = 10$ is a solution, indicating infinitely many solutions.

3. **Logical Flow**: The proof should logically demonstrate that if a system has two distinct solutions, it must have infinitely many solutions. Your proof does not establish this connection clearly. Instead, it jumps to an example without showing how having two distinct solutions implies infinitely many solutions.

4. **General Case**: In general, if a linear system has two distinct solutions, it implies that the system is underdetermined (i.e., there are more variables than independent equations), leading to a solution space that is a line or plane, hence infinitely many solutions.

1. **Linear Combination Argument**: You correctly use the idea of forming a linear combination of two solutions, $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$, to generate new solutions. However, the way you express this is a bit unclear. Specifically, you should emphasize that for any scalar $c$, the vector $\vec{n} = c \vec{u} + (1-c) \vec{v}$ is indeed a solution because $A \vec{n} = A(c \vec{u} + (1-c) \vec{v}) = c A \vec{u} + (1-c) A \vec{v} = c \vec{b} + (1-c) \vec{b} = \vec{b}$.

2. **Infinitely Many Solutions**: You need to clarify why the existence of two distinct solutions implies infinitely many solutions. The key point is that if $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are distinct, then the set $\{c \vec{u} + (1-c) \vec{v} \mid c \in \mathbb{R}\}$ describes a line in the solution space, which contains infinitely many points (solutions).

1. **Assumption and Contradiction**: You correctly start with a proof by contradiction by assuming that $ r $ is rational. However, you should explicitly state that $ x $ and $ y $ are integers with no common factors other than 1 (i.e., $ \frac{x}{y} $ is in lowest terms). This is crucial for the contradiction to work.

2. **Evenness of $ x $ and $ y $**: You correctly deduce that $ x $ must be even because $ x^2 = 2y^2 $ implies $ x^2 $ is even, and hence $ x $ is even. However, when you say ""with the same logic, $ y $ is also even,"" this is not immediately clear. You need to show that if $ x = 2c $, then substituting back into the equation gives $ y^2 = 2c^2 $, which implies $ y $ must also be even. This step is crucial to reach the contradiction.

1. **Inductive Hypothesis and Step**: In the inductive step, you need to assume that the statement is true for some positive integer $ k $, i.e., $(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + k)^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + k^3$. Then, you need to show that this implies $(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + (k+1))^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + (k+1)^3$.

2. **Incorrect Use of Binomial Theorem**: You incorrectly apply the binomial theorem. The expression $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$ is not relevant to the problem. The task is to show the equality of sums of cubes and squares, not to expand a binomial.

Therefore, it is invalid to assume that the number of basis vectors for null(T) would be m.","Your proof contains several errors and misunderstandings. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Basis for Null Space**: You start by saying that $ U_1 = \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_m\} $ is a basis for $\operatorname{null}(T)$, and you claim that $\operatorname{nullity}(T) = m$. However, the nullity of $T$ is the dimension of the null space, which is not necessarily $m$. The nullity is the number of free variables in the solution to $Ax = 0$, and it should be denoted by $k$ (or some other variable), not $m$.

2. **Misinterpretation of Dimensions**: You seem to confuse the dimensions of the null space and the image (range) of $T$. The nullity is not necessarily equal to $m$, and the rank is not necessarily $n-m$. The rank-nullity theorem states that $\operatorname{rank}(T) + \operatorname{nullity}(T) = n$, where $n$ is the number of columns of $A$.

3. **Basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$**: You attempt to construct a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$ by extending the basis for the null space, but you incorrectly assume that the null space has dimension $m$. The correct approach is to extend the basis for the null space to a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$, but the number of additional vectors needed is $n - \operatorname{nullity}(T)$, not $n-m$.

4. **Image of $T$**: You claim that the image of $T$ can be represented by $T(U_3)$ and that its dimension is $n-m$. This is incorrect because the dimension of the image (rank) is not determined by $n-m$ but by the number of linearly independent columns of $A$.

3. **Equality of Linear Combinations**: You need to show that if $\vec{w} = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \ldots + c_n v_n = d_1 v_1 + d_2 v_2 + \ldots + d_n v_n$, then $c_i = d_i$ for all $i$. This follows from the definition of linear independence, which states that the only solution to $c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \ldots + c_n v_n = 0$ is $c_1 = c_2 = \ldots = c_n = 0$.

4. **Conclusion**: You conclude that $\vec{w}_1 - \vec{w}_2 = 0$ implies uniqueness, but you need to explicitly connect this to the coefficients being equal. The key point is that the linear independence of $S$ ensures that the coefficients of the linear combinations must be identical.

Overall, your proof needs to be more explicit in connecting the linear independence of $S$ to the uniqueness of the coefficients in the linear combination.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0

1. **Domain and Codomain:** The function $ f $ is defined from $ \mathbb{Z}^{+} $ to $ \mathbb{Z}^{+} $. This means both the domain and codomain are the set of positive integers. However, your proof considers $ a = b - 1 $ where $ a $ might not be a positive integer. Specifically, if $ b = 1 $, then $ a = 0 $, which is not in the domain $ \mathbb{Z}^{+} $.

2. **Function Definition:** The function $ f(x) = |x+1| $ simplifies to $ f(x) = x + 1 $ for all $ x \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} $ because $ x + 1 $ is always positive for positive $ x $. Therefore, the absolute value does not change the expression. The function $ f(x) = x + 1 $ maps each positive integer $ x $ to the next positive integer $ x + 1 $.

3. **Onto Property:** For $ f $ to be onto, for every $ b \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} $, there must exist an $ a \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} $ such that $ f(a) = b $. However, since $ f(x) = x + 1 $, the smallest value $ f $ can take is 2 (when $ x = 1 $). Therefore, there is no $ a \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} $ such that $ f(a) = 1 $, which means $ f $ is not onto.

1. **Part 1: Proving $3x$ is rational**

   - When you multiply $x$ by 3, you should write:
     $$
     3x = 3 \cdot \frac{p}{q} = \frac{3p}{q}

     Here, $3p$ is an integer because the product of integers is an integer, and $q$ is a non-zero integer. Therefore, $\frac{3p}{q}$ is a rational number.
   - Your statement ""the 3 has no significant impact on $x$"" is not a rigorous justification. Instead, focus on showing that the result is in the form of a rational number.

3. **Second Direction (If $ 2x + 3 $ is rational, then $ x $ is rational)**:
   - You start by assuming $ 2x + 3 = \frac{r}{s} $, where $ r $ and $ s $ are integers and $ s \neq 0 $.
   - You then need to solve for $ x $ to show it is rational. However, your manipulation is incorrect. The correct manipulation should be:
     $$
     2x + 3 = \frac{r}{s} \implies 2x = \frac{r}{s} - 3 = \frac{r}{s} - \frac{3s}{s} = \frac{r - 3s}{s}

   - You correctly state the inductive hypothesis, assuming the statement is true for some positive integer $ k $. However, the transition to the inductive step is not clearly shown. You need to demonstrate that if the statement holds for $ n = k $, then it must also hold for $ n = k+1 $.

2. **Algebraic Manipulation:**

Instead, you need to multiply both sides of the equation by the inverse of the matrix (when it exists).","Your proof contains several logical and mathematical errors. Here are some points of feedback:

1. **One-to-One and Invertibility:**
   - When you assume $ T $ is one-to-one, you correctly state that if $ T(\vec{x}_1) = T(\vec{x}_2) $, then $ \vec{x}_1 = \vec{x}_2 $. However, your manipulation $ \frac{1}{A} A \vec{x}_1 = \vec{x}_2 $ is incorrect. Matrices do not have multiplicative inverses in the same way numbers do, and you cannot divide by a matrix. Instead, you should use the fact that if $ A \vec{x}_1 = A \vec{x}_2 $, then $ A(\vec{x}_1 - \vec{x}_2) = \vec{0} $, which implies $ \vec{x}_1 - \vec{x}_2 = \vec{0} $ if $ A $ is invertible.

2. **Invertibility and Onto:**
   - Your argument for the ""onto"" part is unclear and contains logical errors. You start by assuming $ A $ is invertible and then incorrectly assume $ T $ is onto to reach a contradiction. Instead, you should show that if $ A $ is invertible, then for every $ \vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n $, there exists $ \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n $ such that $ A \vec{x} = \vec{b} $, which directly shows that $ T $ is onto.

3. **Contradiction Misuse:**
   - You attempt to use contradiction in the second part of your proof, but the logic is flawed. You assume $ T $ is onto and then try to show a contradiction, but your reasoning is not clear or correct. Instead, you should directly show the implications of $ T $ being onto.

4. **Nullity and Rank:**
   - Your mention of nullity and rank is not well-integrated into the proof. While these concepts are related to the invertibility of a matrix, they are not used correctly in your argument. The rank-nullity theorem states that for a linear transformation $ T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n $, the rank of $ T $ plus the nullity of $ T $ equals $ n $. If $ T $ is onto, the rank is $ n $, and the nullity is 0, which implies $ A $ is invertible.

You also need to use the fact that the number of pivots and the number of free variables together is equal to n.","Your proof attempts to demonstrate the rank-nullity theorem, but there are several issues with the logic and explanation:

1. **Misunderstanding of Rank and Nullity**: The rank of a linear transformation $ T $ is indeed the dimension of the column space of the matrix $ A $, but the nullity is the dimension of the null space of $ A $, not just a single free variable. The null space consists of all solutions to the homogeneous equation $ A\vec{x} = \vec{0} $.

2. **Assumption of Pivots**: You assume that there are pivots in $ n-1 $ columns without justification. The number of pivot columns (rank) can vary depending on the specific matrix $ A $. It is not always $ n-1 $.

3. **Specific Example Misleading**: You provide a specific example where the rank is $ n-1 $ and the nullity is 1, but this does not prove the theorem in general. The rank-nullity theorem must hold for any $ m \times n $ matrix, not just a specific case.

4. **General Case**: The proof should address the general case, showing that for any $ m \times n $ matrix $ A $, the sum of the rank and nullity equals $ n $. This involves understanding that the rank is the number of pivot columns and the nullity is the number of free variables, which together account for all $ n $ columns.

5. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion that rank plus nullity equals $ n $ is correct, but the reasoning and explanation are flawed. You need to show that the rank and nullity together account for all $ n $ columns of the matrix, which is the essence of the rank-nullity theorem.

2. **Assumption**: You state ""assume there is a $ A^T $ and $(A^{-1})^T A^T = (A A^{-1})^T = I^T = I$"". The existence of $ A^T $ is not an assumption; it is a given because $ A $ is a matrix.

1. **Misunderstanding of Linear Independence**: You state that any vector in $\operatorname{Span}(S)$ should also be linearly independent. This is incorrect. Linear independence is a property of a set of vectors, not individual vectors. A single vector is trivially linearly independent, but this does not relate to the span of a set.

   - You correctly identify that proving the contrapositive is a valid approach. However, your explanation is unclear and lacks precision. When you say ""For $\operatorname{null}(T)$, it means $T=\overrightarrow{0}$,"" this is not accurate. The null space $\operatorname{null}(T)$ is the set of vectors $\vec{v}$ such that $T(\vec{v}) = \overrightarrow{0}$.
   - You need to clearly state that if $T$ is not one-to-one, there exist distinct vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ such that $T(\vec{u}) = T(\vec{v})$.

2. **Direct Proof:**
   - When proving directly, you need to be more precise. For the forward direction, you correctly state that if $T$ is one-to-one, then $T(\vec{a}) = T(\vec{b})$ implies $\vec{a} = \vec{b}$. However, you should explicitly connect this to the null space by considering $T(\vec{v}) = \overrightarrow{0}$ and showing $\vec{v} = \overrightarrow{0}$.
   - For the reverse direction, you need to show that if $\operatorname{null}(T) = \{\overrightarrow{0}\}$, then $T(\vec{a}) = T(\vec{b})$ implies $\vec{a} = \vec{b}$. This follows because $T(\vec{a}) = T(\vec{b})$ implies $T(\vec{a} - \vec{b}) = \overrightarrow{0}$, and since $\operatorname{null}(T) = \{\overrightarrow{0}\}$, it must be that $\vec{a} - \vec{b} = \overrightarrow{0}$, hence $\vec{a} = \vec{b}$.

3. **Clarity and Precision:**

2. **Contradiction Setup**: You should start by assuming that there exists an integer $n$ such that $4$ divides $n^2 + 2$, i.e., $n^2 + 2 = 4a$ for some integer $a$. Then, derive a contradiction from this assumption.

3. **Case Analysis**: You correctly consider the cases where $n$ is even and odd, but your explanations are not clear and contain errors:
   - For even $n$, you correctly set $n = 2x$, leading to $n^2 = 4x^2$. However, your simplification step is unclear. You should show that $4x^2 = 4a - 2$ leads to a contradiction because the left side is divisible by 4, while the right side is not.
   - For odd $n$, you set $n = 2x + 1$, leading to $n^2 = 4x^2 + 4x + 1$. Your simplification is incorrect. You should show that $4x^2 + 4x + 1 = 4a - 2$ leads to a contradiction because the left side is congruent to 1 modulo 4, while the right side is congruent to 2 modulo 4.

4. **Conclusion**: You need to clearly state that since both cases (even and odd $n$) lead to contradictions, the original assumption that there exists an $n$ such that $4$ divides $n^2 + 2$ must be false. Therefore, for every $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, $4$ does not divide $n^2 + 2$.

2. **Incorrect Subset Claims**: You claim $ C - A \subseteq (B - C) - A $, which is incorrect. The correct claim should be $ C - A \subseteq (B \cup C) - A $.

3. **Reversing Implications**: In several places, you reverse the logical implication.

4. **Failure to Use Definitions Properly**: The proof does not consistently use the definitions of set operations (union, difference) to establish the necessary subset relations. Each step should explicitly show how elements from one set satisfy the conditions to be in another set.

5. **Incorrect Conclusion**: The conclusion that $ (B \cup C) - A \subseteq B - A $ and $ (B \cup C) - A \subseteq C - A $ is incorrect. You need to show that every element in $ (B \cup C) - A $ is in either $ B - A $ or $ C - A $, not both.

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Misinterpretation of Linear Independence**: You correctly state that a set $ S $ is linearly independent if the only way to express the zero vector as a linear combination of vectors in $ S $ is by having all coefficients equal to zero. However, this property is not directly used to show uniqueness of representation for non-zero vectors in the span.

2. **Uniqueness of Representation**: The goal is to show that if $\vec{w}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of vectors in $ S $, then this expression is unique. You need to assume that there are two different linear combinations that result in $\vec{w}$ and show that this leads to a contradiction, using the linear independence of $ S $.

3. **Incorrect Use of Zero Vector**: You mention the zero vector and its properties, but this is not relevant to proving the uniqueness of the representation of $\vec{w}$. The zero vector is only relevant when discussing the definition of linear independence.

4. **Confusion with Coefficients**: The proof incorrectly suggests that the coefficients in the linear combination must be zero, which is not the case unless the vector being represented is the zero vector. For a non-zero vector $\vec{w}$, the coefficients are not all zero.

5. **Conclusion Misstep**: The conclusion that one of the vectors in $ S $ is equivalent to $\vec{w}$ is incorrect. In general, $\vec{w}$ is a linear combination of the vectors in $ S$, not necessarily one of the vectors in $ S$.

To prove the theorem correctly, you should assume that $\vec{w}$ can be expressed in two different ways as a linear combination of vectors in $ S$, and then use the linear independence of $ S$ to show that the coefficients in both expressions must be the same, thus proving uniqueness.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0

1. **Structure and Clarity**: The proof is structured around assuming $ n^2 + 2 = 4k $ and then showing contradictions for different cases of $ n $. While this is a valid approach, the presentation could be clearer. Specifically, the transition from assuming divisibility to showing contradictions could be more explicit.

2. **Case Analysis**: You correctly consider cases based on whether $ n $ is even or odd, but the case analysis could be more rigorous. For example, when $ n $ is even, you correctly substitute $ n = 2m $, but the simplification should be more explicit in showing why $ m^2 + \frac{1}{2} $ cannot be an integer.

3. **Mathematical Errors**: In the odd case, you have a small error in the simplification:
   $$
   \frac{(2m+1)^2}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{4m^2 + 4m + 1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = m^2 + m + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = m^2 + m + \frac{3}{4}

Just stating that rank(A)=n doesn't help us understand why the formula rank(T) + nullity(T) = n holds.,"Your proof is on the right track, but there are a few issues and points of clarification needed:

1. **Rank of A**: You start by assuming that the rank of $ A $ is $ n $ in the first case. However, if $ A $ is an $ m \times n $ matrix, the rank cannot exceed $ \min(m, n) $. So, if $ m < n $, the rank cannot be $ n $. You should clarify that you are considering the case where $ m \geq n $ for the rank to be $ n $.

2. **Use of Terminology**: You use the term ""nullspace $(A)$"" and ""nullity $(A)$"". The standard terminology is ""null space of $ A $"" and ""nullity of $ A $"". Also, when you refer to the null space, it should be denoted as $\operatorname{null}(A)$.

3. **Basis for the Null Space**: When you describe the basis for the null space, you mention forming a linear combination of solutions. However, you should clarify that the vectors $ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-k} $ are actually the basis vectors for the null space, not just coefficients in a linear combination.

4. **Clarity and Structure**: Your proof could benefit from a clearer structure.

Also, clearly distinguishing between the two cases (full rank and less than full rank) with proper transitions would improve readability.

   - You correctly show that if $ A $ is invertible, then $ T $ is one-to-one by demonstrating that $ A \vec{x} = A \vec{y} $ implies $ \vec{x} = \vec{y} $. This is a good approach.
   - However, you should also explicitly state the converse: if $ T $ is one-to-one, then $ A $ must be invertible. This can be shown by noting that if $ T $ is one-to-one, the only solution to $ A \vec{x} = \vec{0} $ is $ \vec{x} = \vec{0} $, which implies that $ A $ has full rank and is therefore invertible.

2. **Onto Part:**
   - You correctly argue that if $ T $ is onto, then $ A $ must have a pivot in every row, which implies it is invertible. This is well explained.
   - For the converse, you state that if $ A $ is invertible, then $ T $ is onto. You mention the rank-nullity theorem, which is a good approach, but it could be clearer. Since $ A $ is invertible, it has full rank $ n $, meaning the image of $ T $ is all of $ \mathbb{R}^n $, thus $ T $ is onto.

3. **General Clarity:**
   - Be careful with terminology and ensure that each step logically follows from the previous one. For example, when you mention the rank-nullity theorem, make sure it's clear how it directly applies to the situation.

1. **Misunderstanding of Divisibility and GCD**: You state that ""for any two common divisors of $c a$ and $c b$, their least common multiple is also a divisor of $c a$ and $c b$."" This statement is incorrect. The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is not generally a divisor of those numbers; rather, it is a multiple of them. You might have intended to say something about the greatest common divisor (GCD) instead.

2. **Incorrect Use of GCD Definition**: You claim that $c \cdot \operatorname{gcd}(a, b)$ is a divisor of $\operatorname{gcd}(c a, c b)$ without proper justification. The GCD of $ca$ and $cb$ is not necessarily divisible by $c \cdot \operatorname{gcd}(a, b)$. You need to show that $c \cdot \operatorname{gcd}(a, b)$ divides both $ca$ and $cb$, which would imply it divides their GCD.

3. **Division by $c$**: When you divide $ca = \operatorname{gcd}(ca, cb) \cdot x$ by $c$, you should get $a = \frac{\operatorname{gcd}(ca, cb)}{c} \cdot x$, not $a = \frac{1}{c} n x$. Similarly for $b$. This affects the subsequent logic.

4. **Logical Flow and Clarity**: The proof lacks a clear logical flow and contains several unclear statements. For example, the transition from discussing divisors to concluding that $c \cdot \operatorname{gcd}(a, b) \leq n$ is not well-justified.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion that $m \leq n$ is not properly supported by the arguments presented. You need to establish a clear chain of reasoning that shows why $c \cdot \operatorname{gcd}(a, b)$ is indeed less than or equal to $\operatorname{gcd}(ca, cb)$.

2. **Use of Definitions**: You correctly use the definition of the greatest common divisor, but ensure that you clearly state that since $ c \cdot \operatorname{gcd}(a, b) $ is a common divisor of $ c a $ and $ c b $, it must be less than or equal to the greatest common divisor $ \operatorname{gcd}(c a, c b) $.

3. **Logical Flow**: The logical flow of your proof could be improved by clearly separating the steps. First, establish that $ c \cdot \operatorname{gcd}(a, b) $ is a common divisor of $ c a $ and $ c b $. Then, use the fact that the greatest common divisor is the largest such divisor to conclude the inequality.

4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Some parts of your proof are repetitive. For instance, you restate the definition of the greatest common divisor multiple times. Once is sufficient, and then you can apply it directly.

     $$
     = -2k^2 - 5k - 3

Since $x$ is rational, it can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$ for integers $a$ and $b$ (with $b \neq 0$). Then, $y = (x + y) - x = \frac{m}{n} - \frac{a}{b}$, which simplifies to a rational number, contradicting the assumption that $y$ is irrational.

4. **Conclusion**: The contradiction arises from the assumption that $x + y$ is rational, which forces $y$ to be rational, contradicting the given that $y$ is irrational. Therefore, $x + y$ must be irrational.

1. **Base Cases**: You correctly verified the base cases for $ n = 1 $ and $ n = 2 $. This part is correct.

2. **Inductive Hypothesis (IH)**: You assume that $ a_k = 3k + 5 $ for all integers $ k \geq 2 $. However, for strong induction, you should assume it holds for all integers $ k $ such that $ 1 \leq k \leq n $, not just $ k \geq 2 $. This is a minor point, but it's important for clarity and correctness in strong induction.

3. **Inductive Step**: You need to show that $ a_{k+1} = 3(k+1) + 5 $ assuming the inductive hypothesis holds for all previous terms. Your calculation is mostly correct, but there is a small error in the application of the inductive hypothesis:

   - You correctly start with the recursive formula: 
     $$
     a_{k+1} = 5a_k - 4a_{k-1} - 9
     $$

   - You substitute using the inductive hypothesis:
     $$
     a_k = 3k + 5 \quad \text{and} \quad a_{k-1} = 3(k-1) + 5
     $$

   - Your substitution and simplification should be:
     $$
     a_{k+1} = 5(3k + 5) - 4(3(k-1) + 5) - 9
     $$
     $$
     = 15k + 25 - 12k + 4 - 9

     $$
     = 3k + 20 - 9
     $$
     $$
     = 3k + 11
     $$

   - However, you need to ensure that the simplification leads to $ 3(k+1) + 5 $, which is $ 3k + 8 $. Your simplification should have been:
     $$
     a_{k+1} = 3k + 8
     $$
     $$

   - The error in your simplification is in the arithmetic step where you should have ended with $ 3k + 8 $ instead of $ 3k + 11 $.

Here's some feedback on the issues:

1. **Definition of Transitivity**: The definition of transitivity for a relation $\sim$ is that for all $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}$, if $x \sim y$ and $y \sim z$, then $x \sim z$. Your statement ""$(x,y), (y,z)=(x,z)$"" is not a correct representation of this definition.

2. **Example Usage**: While providing examples can be helpful for understanding, they do not constitute a proof of transitivity. A proof should demonstrate that the property holds for all possible cases, not just specific examples.

3. **Use of Closure Under Addition**: The closure of integers under addition is indeed relevant, but it needs to be applied correctly. If $x \sim y$ and $y \sim z$, then $x - y$ and $y - z$ are integers. You need to show that $(x - y) + (y - z) = x - z$ is also an integer, which follows from the closure of integers under addition.

Here are some specific issues and feedback:

1. **Definition of Transitivity**: The transitive property for a relation $\sim$ on a set $S$ is defined as: for all $a, b, c \in S$, if $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$, then $a \sim c$. Your proof should explicitly state this definition and apply it to the specific relation $\sim$.

2. **Use of Sets**: You mention ""Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be sets in $\mathbb{R}$,"" which is incorrect. $a$, $b$, and $c$ should be elements (or numbers) in $\mathbb{R}$, not sets.

3. **Logical Steps**: You need to show the logical steps that lead from the assumptions $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$ to the conclusion $a \sim c$.

1. **Base Case:**
   - You correctly verified the base case for $ n = 1 $. The calculation shows that both sides of the equation are equal, so the base case holds.

2. **Inductive Step:**
   - You correctly state the inductive hypothesis: Assume that the statement is true for some integer $ n $, i.e., $\sum_{i=1}^n(-4i+1) = -2n^2-n$.
   - You need to show that $\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}(-4i+1) = -2(n+1)^2-(n+1)$.

   - Start from the left-hand side of what you need to prove for $ n+1 $:
     $$
     \sum_{i=1}^{n+1}(-4i+1) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-4i+1)\right) + (-4(n+1) + 1).
     $$
   - By the inductive hypothesis, replace $\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-4i+1)$ with $-2n^2-n$:
     $$
     = -2n^2-n + (-4(n+1) + 1).
     $$
   - Simplify the expression:
     $$
     = -2n^2-n - 4n - 4 + 1.
     $$
     $$
     = -2n^2 - 5n - 3.

   - Now, simplify the right-hand side of what you need to prove:
     $$
     -2(n+1)^2 - (n+1) = -2(n^2 + 2n + 1) - n - 1.
     $$
     $$
     = -2n^2 - 4n - 2 - n - 1.
     $$
     $$
     = -2n^2 - 5n - 3.
